<h2>
THE LOST PIBROCH
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O the make of a piper go seven years of his own learning and seven
generations before. If it is in, it will out, as the Gaelic old-word says;
if not, let him take to the net or sword. At the end of his seven years
one born to it will stand at the start of knowledge, and leaning a fond
ear to the drone, he may have parley with old folks of old affairs.
Playing the tune of the &ldquo;Fairy Harp,&rdquo; he can hear his forefolks, plaided
in skins, towsy-headed and terrible, grunting at the oars and snoring in
the caves; he has his whittle and club in the &ldquo;Desperate Battle&rdquo; (my own
tune, my darling!), where the white-haired sea-rovers are on the shore,
and a stain's on the edge of the tide; or, trying his art on Laments, he
can stand by the cairn of kings, ken the colour of Fingal's hair, and see
the moon-glint on the hook of the Druids!
</p>
<p>
To-day there are but three pipers in the wide world, from the Sound of
Sleat to the Wall of France. Who they are, and what their tartan, it is
not for one to tell who has no heed for a thousand dirks in his doublet,
but they may be known by the lucky ones who hear them. Namely players
tickle the chanter and take out but the sound; the three give a tune the
charm that I mention&mdash;a long thought and a bard's thought, and they
bring the notes from the deeps of time, and the tale from the heart of the
man who made it.
</p>
<p>
But not of the three best in Albainn today is my story, for they have not
the Lost Pibroch. It is of the three best, who were not bad, in a place I
ken&mdash;Half Town that stands in the wood.
</p>
<p>
You may rove for a thousand years on league-long brogues, or hurry on
fairy wings from isle to isle and deep to deep, and find no equal to that
same Half Town. It is not the splendour of it, nor the riches of its folk;
it is not any great routh of field or sheep-fank, but the scented winds of
it, and the comfort of the pine-trees round and about it on every hand. My
mother used to be saying (when I had the notion of fairy tales), that once
on a time, when the woods were young and thin, there was a road through
them, and the pick of children of a country-side wandered among them into
this place to play at sheilings. Up grew the trees, fast and tall, and
shut the little folks in so that the way out they could not get if they
had the mind for it. But never an out they wished for. They grew with the
firs and alders, a quiet clan in the heart of the big wood, clear of the
world out-by.
</p>
<p>
But now and then wanderers would come to Half Town, through the gloomy
coves, under the tall trees. There were packmen with tales of the
out-world. There were broken men flying from rope or hatchet. And once on
a day of days came two pipers&mdash;Gilian, of Clan Lachlan of
Strathlachlan, and Rory Ban, of the Macnaghtons of Dundarave.
</p>
<p>
They had seen Half Town from the sea&mdash;smoking to the clear air on the
hillside; and through the weary woods they came, and the dead quiet of
them, and they stood on the edge of the fir-belt.
</p>
<p>
Before them was what might be a township in a dream, and to be seen at the
one look, for it stood on the rising hill that goes back on Lochow.
</p>
<p>
The dogs barked, and out from the houses and in from the fields came the
quiet clan to see who could be here. Biggest of all the men, one they
named Coll, cried on the strangers to come forward; so out they went from
the wood-edge, neither coy nor crouse, but the equal of friend or foe, and
they passed the word of day.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hunting,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;in Easachosain, we found the roe come this way.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If this way she came, she's at Duglas Water by now, so you may bide and
eat. Few, indeed, come calling on us in Half Town; but whoever they are,
here's the open door, and the horn spoon, and the stool by the fire.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He took them in and he fed them, nor asked their names nor calling, but
when they had eaten well he said to Rory, &ldquo;You have skill of the pipes; I
know by the drum of your fingers on the horn spoon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have tried them,&rdquo; said Rory, with a laugh, &ldquo;a bit&mdash;a bit. My
friend here is a player.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have the art?&rdquo; asked Coll.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, not what yoo might call the whole art,&rdquo; said Gilian, &ldquo;but I can
play&mdash;oh yes!I can play two or three ports.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You can that!&rdquo; said Rory.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No better than yourself, Rory.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, maybe not, but&mdash;anyway, not all tunes; I allow you do
'Mackay's Banner' in a pretty style.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pipers,&rdquo; said Coll, with a quick eye to a coming quarrel, &ldquo;I will take
you to one of your own trade in this place&mdash;Paruig Dali, who is
namely for music.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's a name that's new to me,&rdquo; said Rory, short and sharp, but up they
rose and followed Big Coll.
</p>
<p>
He took them to a bothy behind the Half Town, a place with turf walls and
never a window, where a blind man sat winding pirns for the weaver-folks.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Coll, showing the strangers in at the door, &ldquo;is a piper of
parts, or I'm no judge, and he has as rare a stand of great pipes as ever
my eyes sat on.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have that same,&rdquo; said the blind man, with his face to the door. &ldquo;Your
friends, Coll?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Two pipers of the neighbourhood,&rdquo; Rory made answer. &ldquo;It was for no piping
we came here, but by the accident of the chase. Still and on, if pipes are
here, piping there might be.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; cried Coll; &ldquo;but I must go back to my cattle till night comes.
Get you to the playing with Paruig Dali, and I'll find you here when I
come back.&rdquo; And with that he turned about and went off.
</p>
<p>
Parig put down the ale and cake before the two men, and &ldquo;Welcome you are,&rdquo;
 said he.
</p>
<p>
They ate the stranger's bite, and lipped the stranger's cup, and then,
&ldquo;Whistle 'The Macraes' March,' my fair fellow,&rdquo; said the blind man.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How ken you I'm fair?&rdquo; asked Rory.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your tongue tells that. A fair man has aye a soft bit in his speech, like
the lapping of milk in a cogie; and a black one, like your friend there,
has the sharp ring of a thin burn in frost running into an iron pot. 'The
Macraes' March,' <i>laochain</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Rory put a pucker on his mouth and played a little of the fine tune.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said the blind man, with his head to a side, &ldquo;you had your lesson.
And you, my Strathlachlan boy without beard, do you ken 'Muinntir a'
Ghlinne so'?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How ken ye I'm Strathlachlan and beardless?&rdquo; asked Gilian.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Strathlachlan by the smell of herring-scale from your side of the house
(for they told me yesterday the gannets were flying down Strathlachlan
way, and that means fishing), and you have no beard I know, but in what
way I know I do not know.&rdquo; Gilian had the <i>siubhal</i> of the pibroch
but begun when the blind man stopped him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have it in a way, the Macarthur's way, and
that's not my way. But, no matter, let us to our piping.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The three men sat them down on three stools on the clay floor, and the
blind man's pipes passed round between them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;First,&rdquo; said Paruig (being the man of the house, and to get the vein of
his own pipes)&mdash;&ldquo;first I'll put on them 'The Vaunting.'&rdquo; He stood to
his shanks, a lean old man and straight, and the big drone came nigh on
the black rafters. He filled the bag at a breath and swung a lover's arm
round about it. To those who know not the pipes, the feel of the bag in
the oxter is a gaiety lost. The sweet round curve is like a girl's waist;
it is friendly and warm in the crook of the elbow and against a man's
side, and to press it is to bring laughing or tears.
</p>
<p>
The bothy roared with the tuning, and then the air came melting and sweet
from the chanter. Eight steps up, four, to the turn, and eight down went
Paruig, and the <i>piobaireachd</i> rolled to his fingers like a man's
rhyming. The two men sat on, the stools, with their elbows on their knees,
and listened.
</p>
<p>
He played but the <i>urlar</i>, and the <i>crunluadh</i> to save time, and
he played them well.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good indeed! Splendid, my old fellow!&rdquo; cried the two; and said Gilian,
&ldquo;You have a way of it in the <i>crunluadh</i> not my way, but as good as
ever I heard.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is the way of Padruig Og,&rdquo; said Rory.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well I know it! There are tunes and tunes, and 'The Vaunting' is not bad
in its way, but give me 'The Macraes' March.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He jumped to his feet and took the pipes from the old man's hands, and
over his shoulder with the drones.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stand back, lad!&rdquo; he cried to Gilian, and Gilian went nearer the door.
</p>
<p>
The march came fast to the chanter&mdash;the old tune, the fine tune that
Kintail has heard before, when the wild men in their red tartan came over
hill and moor; the tune with the river in it, the fast river and the
courageous that kens not stop nor tarry, that runs round rock and over
fall with a good humour, yet no mood for anything but the way before it.
The tune of the heroes, the tune of the pinelands and the broad straths,
the tune that the eagles of Loch Duich crack their beaks together when
they hear, and the crows of that country-side would as soon listen to as
the squeal of their babies.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well! mighty well!&rdquo; said Paruig Dali. &ldquo;You have the tartan of the clan in
it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not bad, I'll allow,&rdquo; said Gilian. &ldquo;Let me try.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He put his fingers on the holes, and his heart took a leap back over two
generations, and yonder was Glencoe! The grey day crawled on the white
hills and the Mack roofs smoked below. Snow choked the pass, <i>eas</i>
and corn filled with drift and flatted to the brae-face; the wind tossed
quirky and and in the little bashes and among the smooring lintels and
joists; the Mood of old and young lappered on the hearthstone, and the
bairn, with a knifed throat, had an icy lip on a frozen teat. Out of the
place went the tramped path of the Campbell butchers&mdash;far on their
way to Glenlyon and the towns of paper and ink and liars&mdash;&ldquo;Muinntir
a' ghlinne so, muinntir a' ghlinne so!&mdash;People, people, people of
this glen, this glen, this glen!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dogs! dogs! O God of grace&mdash;dogs and cowards!&rdquo; cried Rory. &ldquo;I could
be dirking a Diarmaid or two if by luck they were near me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is piping that is to be here,&rdquo; said Paruig, &ldquo;and it is not piping for
an hour nor piping for an evening, but the piping of Dunvegan that stops
for sleep nor supper.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
So the three stayed in the bothy and played tune about while time went by
the door. The birds flew home to the branches, the longnecked beasts
flapped off to the shore to spear their flat fish; the rutting deers
bellowed with loud throats in the deeps of the wood that stands round Half
Town, and the scents of the moist night came gusty round the door. Over
the back of Auchnabreac the sun trailed his plaid of red and yellow, and
the loch stretched salt and dark from Cairn Dubh to Creaggans.
</p>
<p>
In from the hill the men and the women came, weary-legged, and the bairns
nodded at their heels. Sleepiness was on the land, but the pipers, piping
in the bothy, kept the world awake.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We will go to bed in good time,&rdquo; said the folks, eating their suppers at
their doors; &ldquo;in good time when this tune is ended.&rdquo; But tune came on
tane, and every tune better than its neighbour, and they waited.
</p>
<p>
A cruisie-light was set alowe in the blind man's bothy, and the three men
played old tunes and new tunes&mdash;salute and lament and brisk dances
and marches that coax tired brogues on the long roads.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here's 'Tulloch Ard' for you, and tell me who made it,&rdquo; said Rory.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who kens that? Here's 'Raasay's Lament,' the best port Padruig Mor ever
put together.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tunes and tunes. I'm for 'A Kiss o' the King's Hand.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Thug mi pòg 'us pòg 'us pòg,
Thug mi pòg do làmh an righ,
Cha do chuir gaoth an craicionn caorach,
Fear a fhuair an fhaoilt ach mi!&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
Then a quietness came on Half Town, for the piping stopped, and the people
at their doors heard but their blood thumping and the night-hags in the
dark of the firwood.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A little longer and maybe there will be more,&rdquo; they said to each other,
and they waited; but no more music came from the drones, so they went in
to bed.
</p>
<p>
There was quiet over Half Town, for the three pipers talked about the Lost
Tune.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A man my father knew,&rdquo; said Gilian, &ldquo;heard a bit of it once in Moideart.
A terrible fine tune he said it was, but sore on the mind.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It would be the tripling,&rdquo; said the Macnaghton, stroking a reed with a
fond hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe. Tripling is ill enough, but what is tripling? There is more in
piping than brisk fingers. Am I not right, Paruig?&rdquo; &ldquo;Right, oh! right. The
Lost <i>Piobaireachd</i> asks for skilly tripling, but Macruimen himself
could not get at the core of it for all his art.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have heard it then!&rdquo; cried Gilian.
</p>
<p>
The blind man stood up and filled out his breast.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Heard it!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I heard it, and I play it&mdash;on the <i>feadan</i>,
but not on the full set. To play the tune I mention on the full set is
what I have not done since I came to Half Town.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have ten round pieces in my sporran, and a bonnet-brooch it would take
much to part me from; but they're there for the man who'll play me the
Lost <i>Piobaireachd</i>&rdquo; said Gilian, with the words tripping each other
to the tip of his tongue.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And here's a Macnaghton's fortune on the top of the round pieces,&rdquo; cried
Rory, emptying his purse on the table.
</p>
<p>
The old man's face got hot and angry. &ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a tinker's
minstrel, to give my tuning for bawbees and a quaich of ale. The king
himself could not buy the tune I ken if he had but a whim for it. But when
pipers ask it they can have it, and it's yours without a fee. Still if you
think to learn the tune by my piping once, poor's the delusion. It is not
a port to be picked up like a cockle on the sand, for it takes the
schooling of years and blindness forbye.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Blindness?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Blindness indeed. The thought of it is only for the dark eye.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If we could hear it on the full set!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come out, then, on the grass, and you'll hear it, if Half Town should
sleep no sleep this night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They went out of the bothy to the wet short grass. Ragged mists shook o'er
Cowal, and on Ben Ime sat a horned moon like a galley of Lorn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I heard this tune from the Moideart man&mdash;the last in Albainn who
knew it then, and he's in the clods,&rdquo; said the blind fellow.
</p>
<p>
He had the mouthpiece at his lip, and his hand was coaxing the bag, when a
bairn's cry came from a house in the Half Town&mdash;a suckling's whimper,
that, heard in the night, sets a man's mind busy on the sorrows that folks
are born to. The drones clattered together on the piper's elbow and he
stayed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have a notion,&rdquo; he said to the two men. &ldquo;I did not tell you that the
Lost <i>Piobaireachd</i> is the <i>piobaireachd</i> of good-byes. It is
the tune of broken clans, that sets the men on the foray and makes cold
hearth-stones. It was played in Glenshira when Gilleasbuig Gruamach could
stretch stout swordsmen from Boshang to Ben Bhuidhe, and where are the
folks of Glenshira this day? I saw a cheery night in Carnus that's over
Lochow, and song and story busy about the fire, and the Moideart man
played it for a wager. In the morning the weans were without fathers, and
Carnus men were scattered about the wide world.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It must be the magic tune, sure enough,&rdquo; said Gilian.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Magic indeed, <i>laochain!</i> It is the tune that puts men on the open
road, that makes restless lads and seeking women. Here's a Half Town of
dreamers and men fattening for want of men's work. They forget the world
is wide and round about their fir-trees, and I can make them crave for
something they cannot name.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good or bad, out with it,&rdquo; said Rory, &ldquo;if you know it at all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe no', maybe no'. I am old and done. Perhaps I have lost the right
skill of the tune, for it's long since I put it on the great pipe. There's
in me the strong notion to try it whatever may come of it, and here's for
it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He put his pipe up again, filled the bag at a breath, brought the booming
to the drones, and then the chanter-reed cried sharp and high.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He's on it,&rdquo; said Rory in Gilian's ear.
</p>
<p>
The groundwork of the tune was a drumming on the deep notes where the
sorrows lie&mdash;&ldquo;Come, come, come, my children, rain on the brae and the
wind blowing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is a salute.&rdquo; said Rory.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's the strange tune anyway,&rdquo; said Gilian; &ldquo;listen to the time of yon!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The tune searched through Half Town and into the gloomy pine-wood; it put
an end to the whoop of the night-hag and rang to Ben Bhreac. Boatmen deep
and far on the loch could hear it, and Half Town folks sat up to listen.
</p>
<p>
It's story was the story that's ill to tell&mdash;something of the heart's
longing and the curious chances of life. It bound up all the tales of all
the clans, and made one tale of the Gaels' past. Dirk nor sword against
the tartan, but the tartan against all else, and the Gaels' target fending
the hill-land and the juicy straths from the pock-pitted little black men.
The winters and the summers passing fast and furious, day and night
roaring in the ears, and then again the clans at variance, and warders on
every pass and on every parish.
</p>
<p>
Then the tune changed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Folks,&rdquo; said the reeds, coaxing. &ldquo;Wide's the world and merry the road.
Here's but the old story and the women we kissed before. Come, come to the
flat-lands rich and full, where the wonderful new things happen and the
women's lips are still to try!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Gilian in his friend's ear&mdash;&ldquo;to-morrow I will go
jaunting to the North. It has been in my mind since Beltane.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;One might be doing worse,&rdquo; said Rory, &ldquo;and I have the notion to try a
trip with my cousin to the foreign wars.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The blind piper put up his shoulder higher and rolled the air into the <i>crunluadh
breabach</i> that comes prancing with variations. Pride stiffened him from
heel to hip, and hip to head, and set his sinews like steel.
</p>
<p>
He was telling of the gold to get for the searching and the bucks that may
be had for the hunting. &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said the reeds, &ldquo;are your poor crops,
slashed by the constant rain and rotting, all for a scart in the bottom of
a pot? What are your stots and heifers&mdash;black, dun, and yellow&mdash;to
milch-cows and horses? Here's but the same for ever&mdash;toil and sleep,
sleep and toil even on, no feud nor foray nor castles to harry&mdash;only
the starved field and the sleeping moss. Let us to a brisker place! Over
yonder are the long straths and the deep rivers and townships strewn thick
as your corn-rigs; over yonder's the place of the packmen's tales and the
packmen's wares: steep we the withies and go!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The two men stood with heads full of bravery and dreaming&mdash;men in a
carouse. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;is the notion we had, but had no words for.
It's a poor trade piping and eating and making amusement when one might be
wandering up and down the world. We must be packing the haversacks.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then the <i>crunluadh mach</i> came fast and furious on the chanter, and
Half Town shook with it. It buzzed in the ear like the flowers in the
Honey Croft, and made commotion among the birds rocking on their eggs in
the wood.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So! so!&rdquo; barked the <i>iolair</i> on Craig-an-eas.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have heard before it was an ill thing to be satisfied; in the morning
I'll try the kids on Maam-side, for the hares here are wersh and tough.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hearken, dear,&rdquo; said the <i>londubh</i>, &ldquo;I know now why my beak is gold;
it is because I once ate richer berries than the whortle, and in season
I'll look for them on the braes of Glenfinne.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Honk-unk,&rdquo; said the fox, the cunning red fellow, &ldquo;am not I the fool to be
staying on this little brae when I know so many roads elsewhere?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And the people sitting up in their beds in Half Town moaned for something
new. &ldquo;Paruig Dall is putting the strange tune on her there,&rdquo; said they.
&ldquo;What the meaning of it is we must ask in the morning, but, <i>ochanoch!</i>
it leaves one hungry at the heart.&rdquo; And then gusty winds came snell from
the north, and where the dark crept first, the day made his first showing,
so that Ben Ime rose black against a grey sky.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's the Lost <i>Piobaireachd</i>,&rdquo; said Paruig Dali when the bag sunk
on his arm.
</p>
<p>
And the two men looked at him in a daze.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes in the spring of the year the winds from Lorn have it their own
way with the Highlands. They will come tearing furious over the hundred
hills, spurred the faster by the prongs of Cruachan and Dunchuach, and the
large woods of home toss before them like corn before the hook. Up come
the poor roots and over on their broken arms go the tall trees, and in the
morning the deer will trot through new lanes cut in the forest.
</p>
<p>
A wind of that sort came on the full of the day when the two pipers were
leaving Half Town.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stay till the storm is over,&rdquo; said the kind folks; and &ldquo;Your bed and
board are here for the pipers forty days,&rdquo; said Paruig Dali. But &ldquo;No&rdquo; said
the two; &ldquo;we have business that your <i>piobaireachd</i> put us in mind
of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm hoping that I did not play yon with too much skill,&rdquo; said the old
man.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Skill or no skill,&rdquo; said Gilian, &ldquo;the like of yon I never heard. You
played a port that makes poor enough all ports ever one listened to, and
piping's no more for us wanderers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Blessings with thee!&rdquo; said the folks all, and the two men went down into
the black wood among the cracking trees.
</p>
<p>
Six lads looked after them, and one said, &ldquo;It is an ill day for a body to
take the world for his pillow, but what say you to following the pipers?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It might,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;be the beginning of fortune. I am weary enough of
this poor place, with nothing about it but wood and water and tufty grass.
If we went now, there might be gold and girls at the other end.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They took crooks and bonnets and went after the two pipers. And when they
were gone half a day, six women said to their men, &ldquo;Where can the lads
be?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We do not know that,&rdquo; said the men, with hot faces, &ldquo;but we might be
looking.&rdquo; They kissed their children and went, with <i>cromags</i> in
their hands, and the road they took was the road the King of Errin rides,
and that is the road to the end of days.
</p>
<p>
A weary season fell on Half Town, and the very bairns dwined at the breast
for a change of fortune. The women lost their strength, and said, &ldquo;To-day
my back is weak, tomorrow I will put things to right,&rdquo; and they looked
slack-mouthed and heedless-eyed at the sun wheeling round the trees. Every
week a man or two would go to seek something&mdash;a lost heifer or a
wounded roe that was never brought back&mdash;and a new trade came to the
place, the selling of herds. Far away in the low country, where the winds
are warm and the poorest have money, black-cattle were wanted, so the men
of Half Town made up long droves and took them round Glen Beag and the
Rest.
</p>
<p>
Wherever they went they stayed, or the clans on the roadside put them to
steel, for Half Town saw them no more. And a day came when all that was
left in that fine place were but women and children and a blind piper.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I the only man here?&rdquo; asked Paruig Dali when it came to the bit, and
they told him he was.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then here's another for fortune!&rdquo; said he, and he went down through the
woods with his pipes in his oxter.
</p>

<h2>
RED HAND
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE smell of wet larch was in the air, and Glenaora was aburst to the
coaxing of Spring. Paruig Dali the piper&mdash;son of the son of Iain Mor&mdash;filled
his broad chest with two men's wind, and flung the drones over his
shoulder. They dangled a little till the bag swelled out, and the first
blast rang in the ear of the morning. Rough and noisy, the reeds cried
each other down till a master's hand held them in check, and the long soft
singing of the <i>piobaireachd</i> floated out among the tartan ribbons.
The grey peak of Drimfern heard the music; the rock that wards the mouth
of Carnus let it pass through the gap and over the hill and down to the
isles below; Dun Corr-bhile and Dunchuach, proud Kilmune, the Paps of
Salachary, and a hundred other braes around, leaned over to listen to the
vaunting notes that filled the valley. &ldquo;The Glen, the Glen is mine!&rdquo; sang
the blithe chanter; and, by Finne's sword, Macruimen himself could not
have fingered it better!
</p>
<p>
It was before Paruig Dali left for Halt Town; before the wars that
scorched the glens; and Clan Campbell could cock its bonnet in the face of
all Albainn. Paruig was old, and Paruig was blind, as the name of him
tells, but he swung with a king's port up and down on the short grass, his
foot firm to every beat of the tune, his kilt tossing from side to side
like a bard's song, his sporran leaping gaily on his brown knees. Two
score of lilting steps to the bumside, a slow wheel on a brogue-heel, and
then back with the sun-glint on the buckles of his belt.
</p>
<p>
The men, tossing the caber and hurling the <i>clachncart</i> against the
sun beyond the peat-bog, paused in their stride at the chanter's boast,
jerked the tartan tight on their loins, and came over to listen; the
women, posting blankets for the coming sheiling, stopped their splashing
in the little linn, and hummed in a dream; and men and women had mind of
the days that were, when the Glen was soft with the blood of men, for the
Stewarts were over the way from Appin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;God's splendour! but he can play too,&rdquo; said the piper's son, with his
head areel to the fine tripling.
</p>
<p>
Then Paruig pushed the bag further into his oxter, and the tune changed.
He laid the ground of &ldquo;Bodaich nam Briogais,&rdquo; and such as knew the story
saw the &ldquo;carles with the breeks&rdquo; broken and flying before Glenurchy's
thirsty swords, far north of Morven, long days of weary march through
spoiled glens.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's fine playing, I'll allow,&rdquo; said the blind man's son, standing below
a saugh-tree with the bag of his bannered pipes in the crook of his arm.
He wore the dull tartan of the Diarmaids, and he had a sprig of gall in
his bonnet, for he was in Black Duncan's tail. &ldquo;Son of Paruig Dali,&rdquo; said
the Chief seven years ago come Martinmas, &ldquo;if you're to play like your
father, there's but Dunvegan for you, and the schooling of Patrick
Macruimen.&rdquo; So Tearlach went to Skye&mdash;cold isle of knives and caves&mdash;and
in the college of Macruimen he learned the <i>piob-mhor</i>. Morning and
evening, and all day between, he fingered the <i>feadan</i> or the full
set&mdash;gathering and march, massacre and moaning, and the stately
salute. Where the lusty breeze comes in salt from Vatemish across Loch
Vegan, and the purple loom of Uist breaks the sunset's golden bars, he
stood on the braes over against Borearaig and charmed the grumbling tide.
And there came a day that he played &ldquo;The Lament of the Harp-Tree,&rdquo; with
the old years of sturdy fight and strong men all in the strain of it, and
Patrick Macruimen said, &ldquo;No more, lad; go home: Lochow never heard another
like you.&rdquo; As a cock with its comb uncut, came the stripling from Skye.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;you play not ill for a blind man, but you miss the
look on the men's faces, and that's half the music. Forbye, you are old,
and your fingers are slow on the grace-notes. Here's your own flesh and
blood can show you fingering there was never the like of anywhere east the
Isles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The stepmother heard the brag. &ldquo;<i>A pheasain!</i>&rdquo; she snapped, with hate
in her peat-smoked face. &ldquo;Your father's a man, and you are but a boy with
no heart for a long day. A place in Black Duncan's tail, with a gillie to
carry your pipes and knapsack, is not, mind ye, all that's to the making
of a piper.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Tearlach laughed in her face. &ldquo;Boy or man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;look at me! north,
east, south, and west, where is the one to beat me? Macruimen has the
name, but there were pipers before Macruimen, and pipers will come after
him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's maybe as you say,&rdquo; said Paruig. &ldquo;The stuff's in you, and what is in
must out; but give me <i>cothrom na Feinne</i>, and old as I am, with
Finne's chance, and that's fair play, I can maybe make you crow less
crouse. Are ye for trying?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am at the training of a new chanter-reed,&rdquo; said Tearlach; &ldquo;but let it
be when you will.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They fixed a day, and went out to play against each other for glory, and
so it befell that on this day Paruig Dali was playing &ldquo;The Glen is Mine&rdquo;
 and &ldquo;Bodaich nam Briogais&rdquo; in a way to make stounding hearts.
</p>
<p>
Giorsal snapped her fingers in her stepson's face when her husband closed
the <i>crunluadh</i> of his <i>piobaireachd.</i>
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you better it, bastard?&rdquo; snarled she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here goes for it, whatever!&rdquo; said Tear-lach, and over his back went the
banner with its boar's head sewn on gold. A pretty lad, by the cross!
clean-cut of limb and light of foot, supple of loin, with the toss of the
shoulder that never a decent piper lacked. The women who had been at the
linn leaned on each other all in the soft larch-scented day, and looked at
him out of deep eyes; the men on the heather arose and stood nigher.
</p>
<p>
A little tuning, and then
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Is comadh leam's comadh leam, cogadh na sithe,
Marbhar 'sa chogadh na crochar's an t-sith mi.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
&ldquo;Peace or war!&rdquo; cried Giorsal, choking in anger, to her man&mdash;&ldquo;peace
or war! the black braggart! it's an asp ye have for a son, goodman!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The lad's fingers danced merry on the chanter, and the shiver of something
to come fell on all the folk around. The old hills sported with the
prancing tune; Dun Corrbhile tossed it to Drimfem, and Drimfern sent it
leaping across the flats of Kilmune to the green corries of Lecknamban.
&ldquo;Love, love, the old tune; come and get flesh!&rdquo; rasped a crow to his mate
far off on misty Ben Bhreac, and the heavy black wings flapped east. The
friendly wind forgot to dally with the pine-tuft and the twanging
bog-myrtle, the plash of Aora in its brown linn was the tinkle of wine in
a goblet. &ldquo;Peace or war, peace or war; come which will, we care not,&rdquo; sang
the pipe-reeds, and there was the muster and the march, hot-foot rush over
the rotting rain-wet moor, the jingle of iron, the dunt of pike and targe,
the choked roar of hate and hunger, batter and slash and fall, and behind,
the old, old feud with Appin!
</p>
<p>
Leaning forward, lost in a dream, stood the swank lads of Aora. They felt
at their hips, where were only empty belts, and one said to his child,
&ldquo;White love, get me yon long knife with the nicks on it, and the
basket-hand, for I am sick of shepherding.&rdquo; The bairn took a look at his
face and went home crying.
</p>
<p>
And the music still poured on. 'Twas &ldquo;I got a Kiss o' the King's Hand&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Pretty Dirk,&rdquo; and every air better than another. The fairy pipe of
the Wee Folk's Knowe never made a sweeter fever of sound, yet it hurt the
ears of the women, who had reason to know the payment of pipers' springs.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop, stop, O Tearlach og!&rdquo; they cried; &ldquo;enough of war: have ye not a
reel in your budget?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There was never a reel in Boreraig,&rdquo; said the lad, and he into &ldquo;Duniveg's
Warning,&rdquo; the tune Coll Ciotach heard his piper play in the west on a day
when a black bitch from Dunstaffnage lay panting for him, and his barge
put nose about in time to save his skin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's the very word itself in it,&rdquo; said Paruig, forgetting the taunting
of Giorsal and all but a father's pride.
</p>
<p>
'Twas in the middle of the &ldquo;Warning&rdquo; Black Duncan, his toe on the stirrup,
came up from Castle Inneraora, with a gillie-wet-foot behind, on his way
to Lochow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's down yonder you should be, Sir Piper, and not blasting here for
drink,&rdquo; said he, switching his trews with his whip and scowling under
black brows at the people. &ldquo;My wife is sick of the <i>clarsach</i> and
wants the pipes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm no woman's piper, Lochow; your wife can listen to the hum of her
spinning-wheel if she's weary of her harp,&rdquo; said the lad; and away rode
the Chief, and back to the linn went the women, and the men to the <i>cabar</i>
and the stone, and Tearlach, with an extra feather in his bonnet, home to
Inneraora, leafing a gibe as he went, for his father.
</p>
<p>
Paruig Dali cursed till the evening at the son he never saw, and his wife
poisoned his mind.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Glen laughs at you, man, from Carnus to Croit-bhile. It's a black,
burning day of shame for you, Paruig Dall!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lord, it's a black enough day for me at the best!&rdquo; said the blind man.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's disgraced by your own ill-got son you are, by a boy with no blood on
his <i>biodag</i>, and the pride to crow over you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And Paruig cursed anew, by the Cross and the Dogs of Lorn, and the White
Glaive of Light the giants wear, and the Seven Witches of Cothmar. He was
bad though he was blind, and he went back to the start of time for his
language. &ldquo;But <i>Dhé!</i> the boy can play!&rdquo; he said at the last.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, <i>amadain dhoill</i>&rdquo; cried the woman; &ldquo;if it was I, a claw was off
the cub before the mouth of day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Witless woman, men have played the pipes before now, lacking a finger:
look at Alasdair Corrag!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Allowing; but a hand's as easy to cut as a finger for a man who has
gralloched deer with a keen <i>sgian-dubh</i>. Will ye do't or no'?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Parig would hearken no more, and took to his pillow.
</p>
<p>
Rain came with the gloaming. Aora, the splendid river, roared up the dark
glen from the Salmon Leap; the hills gathered thick and heavy round about
the scattered townships, the green new tips of fir and the copper leaves
of the young oaks moaned in the wind. Then salt airs came tearing up from
the sea, grinding branch on branch, and the whole land smoked with the
drumming of rain that slanted on it hot and fast.
</p>
<p>
Giorsal arose, her clothes still on her, put a plaid on her black head,
and the thick door banged back on the bed as she dived into the storm. Her
heavy feet sogged through the boggy grass, the heather clutched at her
draggled coat-tails to make her stay, but she filled her heart with one
thought, and that was hate, and behold! she was on the slope of the Black
Bull before her blind husband guessed her meaning. Castle Inneraora lay at
the foot of the woody dun, dozing to the music of the salt loch that made
tumult and spume north and south in the hollow of the mountains. Now and
then the moon took a look at things, now and then a night-hag in the
dripping wood hooted as the rain whipped her breast feathers; a roe leaped
out of the gloom and into it with a feared hoof-plunge above Carlonan; a
thunderbolt struck in the dark against the brow of Ben Ime and rocked the
world.
</p>
<p>
In the cold hour before the mouth of day the woman was in the piper's room
at the gate of Inneraora, where never a door was barred against the night
while Strong Colin the warder could see from the Fort of Dunchuach to
Cladich. Tearlach the piper lay on his back, with the glow of a half-dead
peat on his face and hands. &ldquo;Paruig, Paruig!&rdquo; said the woman to herself,
as she softly tramped out the peat-fire and turned to the bed. And lo! it
was over. Her husband's little black knife made a fast sweep on the
sleeper's wrist, and her hand was drenched with the hot blood of her
husband's son.
</p>
<p>
Tearlach leaped up with a roar in the dark and felt for his foe; but the
house was empty, for Giorsal was running like a hind across the soaked
stretch of Caimban. The lightning struck at Glenaora in jagged fury and
confusion; the thunder drummed hollow on Creag
</p>
<p>
Dubh: in a turn of the pass at the Three Bridges the woman met her
husband.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Daughter of hell!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is't done? and was't death?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; said she, with a fond laugh, &ldquo;'twas only a brat's hand. You can
give us 'The Glen is Mine!' in the morning.&rdquo;
 </p>

<h2>
THE SECRET OF THE HEATHER-ALE
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>OWN Glenaora threescore and ten of Diarmaid's stout fellows took the road
on a fine day. They were men from Carnus, with more of Clan Artair than
Campbell in them; but they wore Gilleasbuig Gruamach's tartan,. and if
they were not on Gilleasbuig Gruamach's errand, it makes little difference
on our story. It was about the time Antrim and his dirty Irishers came
scouring through our glens with flambeaux, dirk and sword and other arms
invasive, and the country was back at its old trade of fighting, with not
a sheiling from end to end, except on the slopes of Shira Glen, where a
clan kept free of battle and drank the finest of heather-ale that the
world envied the secret of.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lift we and go, for the Cattle's before!&rdquo; said Alasdair Piobaire on the
chanter of a Dunvegan great-pipe&mdash;a neat tune that roared gallant and
far from Carnus to Bara-caldine; so there they were, the pick of swank
fellows on the road!
</p>
<p>
At the head of them was Niall Mor a' Chamais&mdash;the same gentleman
namely in story for many an art and the slaughter of the strongest man in
the world, as you'll find in the writings of my Lord Archie. &ldquo;God! look at
us!&rdquo; said he, when his lads came over the hill in the grey mouth of day.
&ldquo;Are not we the splendid men? Fleas will there be this day in the hose of
the Glenshira folk.&rdquo; And he sent his targe in the air in a bravado,
catching it by the prong in its navel, smart and clean, when it whirled
back.
</p>
<p>
Hawks yelped as they passed; far up on Tullich there was barking of
eagles; the brogues met the road as light as the stagslot; laughing,
singing, roaring; sword-heads and pikes dunting on wooden targets&mdash;and
only once they looked back at their women high on the brae-face.
</p>
<p>
The nuts were thick on the roadside, hanging heavy from swinging branches,
and some of the men pulled them off as they passed, stayed for more,
straggled, and sang bits of rough songs they ken over many of on
Lochowside to this day. So Niall Mor glunched at his corps from under his
bonnet and showed his teeth.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Gather in, gather in,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;ye march like a drove of low-country
cattle. Alasdair, put 'Baile Inneraora' on her!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Alasdair changed his tune, and the good march of Clan Diarmaid went
swinging down the glen.
</p>
<p>
The time passed; the sun stood high and hot; clucking from the
fir-plantings came woodcock and cailzie; the two rivers were crossed, and
the Diarmaids slockened their thirst at the water of Altan Aluinn, whose
birth is somewhere in the bogs beside tall Bhuidhe Ben.
</p>
<p>
Where the clans met was at the Foal's Gap, past Maam. A score of the
MacKellars ran out in a line from the bushes, and stotted back from the
solid weight of Diarmaid moving in a lump and close-shouldered in the
style Niall Mor got from the Italian soldier. Some fell, hacked on the
head by the heavy slash of the dry sword; some gripped too late at the
pikes that kittled them cruelly; and one&mdash;Iver-of-the-Oars&mdash;tripped
on a root of heather, and fell with his breast on the point of a
Diarmaid's dirk.
</p>
<p>
To the hills went a fast summons, and soon at the mouth of the gap came
twoscore of the MacKellars. They took a new plan, and close together faced
the green tartan, keeping it back at the point of steel, though the pick
of Glenaora wore it, and the brogues slipped on the brae-face. It was fast
cut and drive, quick flash of the dirk, with the palm up and the hand low
to find the groin, and a long reach with the short black knife. The choked
breath hissed at teeth and nose, the salt smell of new blood brought a
shiver to birch-leaf and gall. But ever the green tartan had the best of
it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Bas, bas, Dhiarmaid!</i>&rdquo; cried Calum Dubh, coming up on the back of
his breaking two-score with fresh lads from Elerigmor, bed-naked to the
hide, and a new fury fell on the two clans tearing at it in the narrow
hollow in between the rocky hills. So close they were, there was small
room for the whirl of the basket-hilt, and &ldquo;Mind Tom-a-Phubaill and the
shortened steel!&rdquo; cried Niall Mor, smashing a pretty man's face with a
blow from the iron guard of his Ferrara sword. The halberts, snapped at
the haft to make whittles, hammered on the target-hides like stones on a
coffin, or rang on the bosses; the tartan ripped when the stuck one rolled
on his side before the steel could be twisted out; below the foot the
grass felt warm and greasy, and the reason was not ill to seek.
</p>
<p>
Once it looked like the last of Calum Dubh. He was facing Niall Mor, sword
and targe, and Niall Mor changed the sword to the other hand, pulled the
<i>sgian-dubh</i> from his garter, and with snapping teeth pushed like a
lightning fork below MacKellar's target. An Elerigmor man ran in between;
the little black knife sunk into his belly with a moist plunge, and the
blood spouted on the deer-horn haft.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mallachd ort!</i> I meant yon for a better man,&rdquo; cried Niall Mor; &ldquo;but
it's well as it is, for the secret's to the fore,&rdquo; and he stood up dour
and tall against a new front of Mac-Kellar's men.
</p>
<p>
Then the sky changed, and a thin smirr of warm rains fell on the glen like
smoke; some black-cattle bellowed at the ford in a wonder at where their
herds could be, and the herds&mdash;stuck, slashed, and cudgelled&mdash;lay
stiffening on the torn grass between the gap and Mac-Kellar's house. From
end to end of the glen there was no man left but was at the fighting. The
hook was tossed among the corn; the man hot-foot behind the roe, turned
when he had his knife at its throat, to go to war; a lover left his lass
among the heather; and all, with tightened belts, were at the old game
with Clan Diarmaid, while their women, far up on the sappy levels between
the hill-tops and beside the moor-lochs, span at the wheel or carded wool,
singing songs with light hearts and thinking no danger.
</p>
<p>
Back went MacKellar's men before Niall
</p>
<p>
Mor and his sturdy lads from Camus, the breeder of soldiers&mdash;back
through the gap and down on the brae to the walls of Calum Dubh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Illean, 'illean!&rdquo; cried Calum; &ldquo;lads, lads! they have us, sure enough.
Oh! pigs and thieves! squint mouths and sons of liars!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The cry gathered up the strength of all that was left of his clan, Art and
Uileam, the Maam lads, the brothers from Drimlea and two from over Stron
hill, and they stood up together against the Carnus men&mdash;a gallant
madness! They died fast and hard, and soon but Calum and his two sons were
left fencing, till a rush of Diarmaids sent them through the door of the
house and tossed among the peats.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Give in and your lives are your own,&rdquo; said Niall Mor, wiping his sword on
his shirtsleeve, and with all that were left of his Diarmaids behind his
back.
</p>
<p>
To their feet stood the three MacKellars.
</p>
<p>
Calum looked at the folk in front of him, and had mind of other ends to
battles. &ldquo;To die in a house like a rat were no great credit,&rdquo; said he, and
he threw his sword on the floor, where the blades of Art and Uileam soon
joined it.
</p>
<p>
With tied arms the father and his sons were taken outside, where the air
was full of the scents of birch and gall new-washed. The glen, clearing
fast of mist, lay green and sweet for mile and mile, and far at its mouth
the fat Blaranbuie woods chuckled in the sun.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have you now,&rdquo; said Niall Mor. &ldquo;Ye ken what we seek. It's the old ploy&mdash;the
secret of the ale.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Calum laughed in his face, and the two sons said things that cut like
knives.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Man! I'm feared ye'll rue this,&rdquo; said Niall Mor, calm enough. &ldquo;Ye may
laugh, but&mdash;what would ye call a gentleman's death?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;With the sword or the dagger in the hand, and a Diarmaid or two before
me,&rdquo; cried Calum.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, there might be worse ways of travelling yont&mdash;indeed there
could ill be better; but if the secret of the ale is not to be ours for
the asking, ye'll die a less well-bred death.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Name it, man, name it,&rdquo; said Calum. &ldquo;Might it be tow at the throat and a
fir-branch.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Troth,&rdquo; said Niall Mor, &ldquo;and that were too gentle a travelling. The
Scaurnoch's on our way, and the crows at the foot of it might relish a
Glen Shira carcass.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Uileam whitened at the notion of so ugly an end, but Calum only said, &ldquo;Die
we must any way,&rdquo; and Art whistled a bit of a pipe-tune, grinding his heel
on the moss.
</p>
<p>
Niall Mor made to strike the father on the face, but stayed his hand and
ordered the three in-by, with a few of his corps to guard them. Up and
down Glen Shira went the Diarmaids, seeking the brewing-cave, giving hut
and home to the flame, and making black hearths and low lintels for the
women away in the sheilings. They buried their dead at Kilblaan, and, with
no secret the better, set out for Scaurnoch with Calum and his sons.
</p>
<p>
The MacKellars were before, like a <i>spreidh</i> of stolen cattle, and
the lot of the driven herd was theirs. They were laughed at and spat on,
and dirk-hilts and <i>cromags</i> hammered on their shoulders, and through
Blaranbuie wood they went to the bosky elbow of Dun Corr-bhile and round
to the Dun beyond.
</p>
<p>
Calum, for all his weariness, stepped like a man with a lifetime's plans
before his mind; Art looked about him in the fashion of one with an eye to
woodcraft; Uileam slouched with a heavy foot, white at the jaw and wild of
eye.
</p>
<p>
The wood opened, the hunting-road bent about the hill-face to give a level
that the eye might catch the country spread below. Loch Finne stretched
far, from Ardno to French Foreland, a glassy field, specked with one sail
off Creaggans. When the company came to a stand, Calum Dubh tossed his
head to send the hair from his eyes, and looked at what lay below. The
Scaurnoch broke at his feet, the grey rock-face falling to a depth so deep
that weary mists still hung upon the sides, jagged here and there by the
top of a fir-tree. The sun, behind the Dun, gave the last of her glory to
the Cowal Hills; Hell's Glen filled with wheeling mists; Ben Ime, Ben
Vane, and Ben Arthur crept together and held princely converse on the
other side of the sea.
</p>
<p>
All in a daze of weariness and thinking the Diarmaids stood, and looked
and listened, and the curlews were crying bitter on the shore.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, haste ye, lads, or it's not Carnus for us to-night,&rdquo; cried Niall Mor.
&ldquo;We have business before us, and long's the march to follow. The secret,
black fellow!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Calum Dubh laughed, and spat in a bravado over the edge of the rock.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, fool; if we have not the word from you before the sun's off Sithean
Sluaidhe, your sleep this night is yonder,&rdquo; and he pointed at the pit
below.
</p>
<p>
Calum laughed the more. &ldquo;If it was hell itself,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I would not
save my soul from it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look, man, look! the Sithean Sluaidhe's getting black, and any one of ye
can save the three yet. I swear it on the cross of my knife.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Behind the brothers, one, John-Without-Asking, stood, with a gash on his
face, eager to give them to the crows below.
</p>
<p>
A shiver came to Uileam's lips; he looked at his father with a questioning
face, and then stepped back a bit from the edge, making to speak to the
tall man of Chamis.
</p>
<p>
Calum saw the meaning, and spoke fast and thick.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop, stop,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it's a trifle of a secret, after all, and to save
life ye can have it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Art took but a little look at his father's face, then turned round on
Shira Glen and looked on the hills where the hunting had many a time been
sweet. &ldquo;Maam no more,&rdquo; said he to himself; &ldquo;but here's death in the hero's
style!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought you would tell it,&rdquo; laughed Niall Mor. &ldquo;There was never one of
your clan but had a tight grip of his little life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said Calum Dubh; &ldquo;but it's <i>my</i> secret. I had it from one who
made me swear on the holy steel to keep it; but take me to Carnus, and
I'll make you the heather-ale.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So be't, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But there's this in it, I can look no clansmen nor kin in the face after
telling it, so Art and Uileam must be out of the way first.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Death, MacKellar?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That same.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Uileam shook like a leaf, and Art laughed, with his face still to Shira,
for he had guessed his father's mind.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith!&rdquo; said Niall Mor, &ldquo;and that's an easy thing enough,&rdquo; and he nodded
to John-Without-Asking.
</p>
<p>
The man made stay nor tarry. He put a hand on each son's back and pushed
them over the edge to their death below. One cry came up to the listening
Diarmaids, one cry and no more&mdash;the last gasp of a craven.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now we'll take you to Camus, and you'll make us the ale, the fine ale,
the cream of rich heather-ale,&rdquo; said Niall Mor, putting a knife to the
thongs that tied MacKellar's arms to his side.
</p>
<p>
With a laugh and a fast leap Calum Dubh stood back on the edge of the rock
again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Crook-mouths, fools, pigs' sons! did ye think it?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come with
me and my sons and ye'll get ale, ay, and death's black wine, at the foot
of Scaurnoch.&rdquo; He caught fast and firm at John-Without-Asking, and threw
himself over the rock-face. They fell as the scart dives, straight to the
dim sea of mist and pine-tip, and the Diarmaids threw themselves on their
breasts to look over. There was nothing to see of life but the crows
swinging on black feathers; there was nothing to hear but the crows
scolding.
</p>
<p>
Niall Mor put the bonnet on his head and said his first and last friendly
thing of a foe.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;had the heart of a man!&rdquo;
 </p>

<h2>
BOBOON'S CHILDREN
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ROM Knapdale to Lorn three wandering clans share the country between
them, and of the three the oldest and the greatest are the swart
Macdonalds, children of the Old Boboon.
</p>
<p>
You will come on them on Wade's roads,&mdash;jaunty fellows, a bit dour in
the look, and braggart; or girls with sloe-eyes, tall and supple, not with
a flat slouching foot on the soil, but high in the instep, bounding and
stag-sure. At their head will be a long lean old man on crutches&mdash;John
Fine Macdonald&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Old Boboon, the father and head of the noblest of wandering tribes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; will Boboon say to you, &ldquo;I am the fellow you read of in books as
the teller of Fingalian tales; wilt hear one of them for a poor Saxon
shilling, or wilt buy my lures for the fish? Or perhaps a display of
scholarly piping by my daughter's son&mdash;the gallant scamp!&mdash;who
has carried arms for his king?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If one must have the truth, the piping is bad piping, but the fish-lures
and the tales are the best in the world. You will find some of the tales
in the writings of Iain Og of Isla&mdash;such as &ldquo;The Brown Bear of the
Green Glen&rdquo;; but the best are to hear as Boboon minds them when he sits
with you on the roadside or on the heather beside the evening fire, when
the brown fluffy eagles bark at the mist on Braevallach. Listen well to
them, for this person has the gift. He had it from his father, who had it
from <i>his</i> father, who had it from a mother, who, in deep trouble and
disease, lay awake through long nights gathering thoughts as healthy folks
gather nuts&mdash;a sweet thing enough from a sour husk.
</p>
<p>
And if time were your property (as it should be the portion of every
wiselike man), you might hear many tales from Old Boboon, but never the
tale of his own three chances.
</p>
<p>
It happened once upon a time that the captain in the town took a notion to
make Boboon into a tame house-man instead of a creature of the woods and
highways. He took him first by himself and clapped him into a kilt of his
own tartan eight yards round the buttocks, full pleated, with hose of fine
worsted, and a coat with silver buttons. He put a pickle money in his
sporran, and gave him a place a little way down his table. The feeding was
high and the work was to a wanderer's fancy; for it was but whistling to a
dog now and then, chanting a stave, or telling a story, or roaming through
the garden behind the house.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; said Boboon, &ldquo;am not I the sturdy fellow come to his own?&rdquo; and
about the place he would go with a piper's swagger, switching the grass
and shrubs with a withie as he went, in the way gentlemen use
riding-sticks.
</p>
<p>
But when Inneraora town lay in the dark of the winter night, and the
captain's household slept, Boboon would hear his clan calling on him
outside the wall.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Boboon! oh, Boboon! old hero! come and collogue with your children.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He would go to the wall, which was lower on the inside than the out (and
is, indeed, the wall of old Quinten, where a corps of Campbells,
slaughtered by Inverlochy dogs, lie under a Latin stone), and he would
look down at his friends running about like pole-cats in the darkness, in
their ragged kilts and trews, their stringy hair tossing in the wind. The
women themselves would be there, with the bairns whining on their backs.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay! ay! this is you, my hearty folk!&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;glad am I to see you
and smell the wood-fire reek off you. How is it on the road?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;From here we have not moved since you left us, John Fine. We are camped
in the Blue Quarry, and you never came near your children and friends.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;God! and here's the one that's sorry for that same. But over the walls
they will not let me. 'If gentleman you would be,' says the captain, 'you
must keep out of woods and off the highway.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you like it, Boboon?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Like it, heroes! But for the honour and ease of it, give me a fir-root
fire in Glen Croe and a dinner of <i>fuarag</i>. It is not the day so much
as the night. Lying in-by there on a posted-bed, I choke for the want of
air, though the windows and doors are open wide.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come away with us, Boboon; we have little lack with the fish, and few are
our stories since you took to the town.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no, dears. Conan's curse, and I tell you no! In this place there is
comfort, and every day its own bellyful.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But the freedom outbye, John, old hero! Last night we had the bravest of
fires; the sparks flew like birds among the Duke's birches, the ground was
snug and dry, and-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Begone! I tell ye no!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Listen! To-day we were among the white hares beyond the Beannan,
thwacking the big fat fellows with our clubs. Such sport was not in all
Albainn!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;White hares!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;White hares, old John! And Alasdair Beag has some new tunes since you
left us&mdash;a <i>piobaireachd</i> he picked up from a Mull man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Would it be 'Failte an Roich '?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Better than that by far; a masterly tune! Come out and hear him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But Old Boboon leaned with his arms on the wall and made no move to be off
with his children.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come and stravaig,&rdquo; said the girls, and his daughter Betty put a foot in
a cranny and pulled herself up beside him to put coaxing arms round his
neck.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Calf of my heart!&rdquo; said Boboon, stroking her hair, soft handed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We have the fine feeding,&rdquo; said the girl in his ear. &ldquo;Yesterday it was
plotted trout in the morning and tunnag's eggs; dinner was a collop off a
fat hind.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A grailoched hind?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, nor grailoched! That is a fool's fashion and the spoiling of good
meat. But come with us, father. Think of the burns bubbling, and the stars
through the branches, and the fresh airs of the morning!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Down, down, you bitch! Would ye tempt me?&rdquo; cried Boboon, pushing the girl
from the wall and hurrying back with shaking knees to the Latin stone. The
night was deep black, and for all he could tell by eyesight, he might have
been in the middle of breezy Moor Rannoch, but the town gables crowded
'thick and solid round his heart. He missed the free flowing winds; there
was a smell of peat and coal from dead house-fires, and he spat the dust
of lime from his throat.
</p>
<p>
Over the wall the clan scraped and skurried as weasels do. They dared make
no noise for fear the town should waken, but in hoarse voices they called
all together&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Boboon, Boboon, oh! come home to the wood, Boboon!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am not I the poor caged one?&rdquo; said Boboon to himself, and he ran in that
he might hear no more.
</p>
<p>
It was the same the next night and the next, and it looked like going on
without end. Ever the wanderers coming at night to the wall and craving
their head to come out. And one night they threw over a winged black-cock,
that fell with beating feathers at Boboon's feet as he stood in the dark
listening to the swart Macdonalds whining outbye.
</p>
<p>
He picked up the bird and ran kind fingers through its feathers. The heat
coursed in its breast and burned to a fever in its wounded oxter. Its
little heart beat on Boboon's thumb like a drumstick.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor bird!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;well I ken where ye came from, and the merry times
ye had. Ye hatched in the braes of Ben Bhuidhe, and clucked on the reedy
places round about the side of that tall hill. Before your keen eyes in
the morning was the Dubh Loch, and the Shira&mdash;winding like a silver
belt. Sure am I ye took wing for it with the day, and over Stuc Scardan to
Aora Glen to make merry among your mates in the heather and the fern. Oh!
<i>choillich-dhuibh, choillich-dhuibh</i>, hard's our fate with broken
wings and the heart still strong!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He thrawed the bird's neck, and then went over the wall to join his clan.
</p>
<p>
His second chance ended no better. He was back in a new kilt and jacket a
twelvemonth later, and this time the captain tried the trick of a dog's
freedom&mdash;oat on the road as he liked by day, but kennel at night.
</p>
<p>
One day Boboon was on his master's errand round Stron. It was the spring
of the year. The shore, at the half-ebb, was clean and sweet, and the tide
lapped at the edge as soft as a cat at milk.
</p>
<p>
Going round Stron on the hard yellow road, he got to think of the sea's
good fortune,&mdash;of the many bays it wandered into by night or day; of
its friendship with far-out forelands, and its brisk quarrels with the
black rocks. Here was no dyke at any time, but all freedom, the
restlessness and the roaming, sleep or song as the mood had it, and the
ploys with galleys and gabberts; the cheery halloo of the winds and the
waving of branches on foreign isles to welcome one.
</p>
<p>
The road opened before him in short swatches&mdash;the sort of road a
wanderer likes, with not too much of it to be seen at one look. In the
hazel-wood by the way the bark of the young trees glistened like brass;
thin new switches shot out straight as shelisters.
</p>
<p>
John Fine, with the sun heating his back, started at the singing of
Donnacha Ban's &ldquo;Coire Cheathaich&rdquo;:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;O 'twas gladsome to go a-hunting
Out in the dew of the sunny mom!
For the great red stag was never wanting,
Nor the fawn, nor the doe with never a horn.
My beauteous corri, my misty corri!
What light feet trod thee in joy and pride!
What strong hand gathered thy precious treasures,
What great hearts leaped on thy craggy side!&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
Rounding Dundarave, the road lay straight before him till it thinned in
the distance to a needle-point pricking the trees, and at the end of it
was a cloud of dust.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What have I here?&rdquo; said Boboon to himself, stretching out with long
steps, the kilt flapping against the back of his knees.
</p>
<p>
The cloud came close, and lo! here was his own clan on the march, draggled
and stoury, rambling, scattered like crows, along the road.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Boboon! Boboon!&rdquo; they cried, and they hung about him, fingering his fine
clothes.
</p>
<p>
He looked at their brown flesh, he saw the yellow soil in the crannies of
their brogues, the men loose and blackguardly, the women red-cheeked,
ripe, and big-breasted, with bold eyes, and all had enchantment for him! A
stir set up in his heart that he could not put down.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where were you yesterday?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;On the side of the Rest in Glen Croe, with dry beds of white hay and no
hurry.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you for?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you forgotten the wanderer's ways, Boboon? Where does this road go
to?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well ye ken, my heroes! It goes to the end of a man's will. If the man'
says, 'I bide here,' it's the end of the road; but if he has the notion,
it will take him to the end of days. That, by my soul! is the charm of all
roads that are not in towns; and now that I think of it, let the captain
whistle on his errand, for I'm Boboon and sick of the causey stones.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
So night found Boboon and his clan far in at the back of Auchnabreac,
town-muir and bonny place, where some we ken would sooner be than
wandering o'er the world.
</p>
<p>
And the days passed, and at Martinmas the captain was at Kilmichael
Market, and he came on Boboon with his people on the edge of the
market-place. Boboon in those days was as straight as a young saugh-wand,
sharp and thin, all thong at the joints, and as supple as a wild cat. He
was giving a display with the <i>sgian-dubh</i>, stabbing it on the ground
at the back of his left heel and twisting his right arm round the leg to
get the blade out of the ground without bending the knee. It was a trick
to take the eye, but neither bardic nor soldierly, yet there was a throng
of drovers about him. Along with him was his daughter Betty, who took
after him for looks, but had her dead mother's dainty tongue, and from her
mother a little book-schooling John Fine had never the need of.
</p>
<p>
The eye of the captain fell on the two of them as they stood there, with
their forty clan-folk going about the market, and he was gripped by a new
notion to give Boboon the third and the last chance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Boboon!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come back to the town this once, and I'll put you and
your daughter up together in a house of your own.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Before a week was out the thing was as he wanted. Boboon and Betty got a
room in Macvicar's Land, with a wooden floor, and a fire on the side of
the wall with a built-in chimney, and other gentilities beside. They
stayed for months, and they stayed for years, and the clan craved them in
vain to come home. Betty was put to the books and the arts of ladydom by
the captain's mother and sister, and she took to them like a Ridir's
daughter. She lost the twang of the road-folk; she put her errant hair in
leash; she grew to the habit of snodding and redding, until for grace and
good looks she was the match of them that taught her.
</p>
<p>
One day the captain, walking in his garden in deep cogitation, fell in the
way of the girl as she roamed among the bushes. He got for the first time
the true glance of her (for one may look at a person for years and not see
the reality till a scale falls from the eyes), and behold! here was a
woman who set his heart drumming.
</p>
<p>
It was that very night Boboon put an end to his last chance.
</p>
<p>
The strong sun of the day left the night hot and clammy, and a haze hung
on the country such as one sees in these parts in keenest frost.
Macvicar's Land was full of smells&mdash;of sweating flesh and dirty
water, of fish and the rotting airs of sunless holes&mdash;and the dainty
nose of Macdonald took a disgust. He flung open door and window, and
leaned out at the window with his neck bared and his mouth stretched wide
gasping to the air. The bairns in the back-land looked up and laughed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look at Boboon, Boboon, Boboon, the father of Lady Betty!&rdquo; they cried,
and John Fine shook his fist and cursed their families.
</p>
<p>
But there was no ease from the trouble in this fashion, so he got up and
went behind the town, and threw himself under the large trees with an ear
to the ground. Beside him the cattle crunched the sappy grass in so sweet
and hearty mouthfuls that he could well wish he had the taste of nature
himself, and they breathed great breaths of content. His keen ears could
catch the hopping of beasts on the grass and the scratching of claws in
the wood, he could hear the patter of little feet, and the birds above him
scraping on the bark when they turned in their sleep. A townman would
think the world slept, so great was the booming of quietness; but Boboon
heard the song of the night, the bustle of the half world that thrives in
shade and starshine.
</p>
<p>
Leaning now on an elbow, he let his eyes rove among the beeches, into the
bossy tops, solemn and sedate, and the deep recesses that might be full of
the little folk of fairy-land at their cantrips. And then farther back and
above all was Dunchuach the stately, lifting its face, wood-bearded, to
the stars!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If a wind was here it was all I wanted,&rdquo; said Boboon, and when he said it
the wind came&mdash;a salty air from the sea. The whole country-side
cooled and gave out fresh scents of grass and earth.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;O God! O God!&rdquo; cried the wanderer, &ldquo;here we are out-by, the beasts and
the birds and the best of Boboon together! Here is the place for ease and
the full heart.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He up and ran into the town, and up to the captain's gate and in.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; he cried, 'it's the old story,&mdash;I must be taking the road
for it; here's no rest for John Fine Macdonald!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you'll leave the girl,&rdquo; said the captain, who saw the old fever in
the man's eyes; &ldquo;I have taken a notion of her, and&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So be it! let her bide.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll marry her before the morn's out.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Marry!&rdquo; cried Boboon, putting back his hair from his face with a nervous
hand. &ldquo;You would marry a wanderer's child?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, they'll talk, no doubt; but she has gifts to make them forget, and
she's good enough to make a king's woman.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Boboon, &ldquo;I have but one thing to say, and that's our own
Gaelic old-word, 'There are few lapdogs in a fox's litter.'&rdquo; The captain's
face got as red as his vest, and he had a ready hand up for an answer to
Boboon, but he had mind the man was the girl's father.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll risk it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you can go your wandering ways, for Betty is
willing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No doubt, no doubt,&rdquo; said Boboon, and he went. In the hollow of the night
he was hooting back like a boy at the hoolets on the slopes of
Coillevraid, and at the mouth of day, in a silver wet light, he was
standing on the edge of the hills that look on two lochs, his head high
like a scenting deer's. He turned him round about to all airts with his
eyes from Cruachan to Cowal, and as far between Knapdale and Lorn as a
wanderer has vision, and yonder, down at Kames, was the camp of his clan!
</p>
<p>
Betty his daughter left Macvicar's Land in the morning and went to be
captain's wife, with a seat in the kirk and callers from the castle
itself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wait, wait,&rdquo; said old Craignure, when the tale reached him, &ldquo;you'll see
the fox come out on her ere long.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But the fox was not there; it was skipping a day, as the fox will do
sometimes when the day before has been good hunting. All went well with
the woman till the worst that might have been the best happened, and she
died with her first child. It was the year of the stunted oats, that
brought poverty to Inneraora and black bread to the captain's board; but
black bread and brochan would have been the blithest of meat for him if
Betty was left to share it. He took to the bottle, and left the boy to
women who had no skill of wild youth.
</p>
<p>
And the child grew like a fir-tree, straight and tall, full of hot blood,
swung about by whim and the moment's fancy. For him it was ever the horse
and gun, a snatched dinner and hearty, and off to the wood or hill. He got
to know the inner ways of the beasts that hide in the coarse grasses and
the whin; at a whistle he could coax flapping birds to come to heel. A
loose vest and a naked neck for ever were marring his gentility, and his
closest friends were countrymen with hard hands and the loud ready laugh.
</p>
<p>
One day it came to the captain's mind that something must be made of this
young blade, and he sent for him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are you at your books?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, but&mdash;but I ken a short way with the badgers,&rdquo; the lad made
answer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you have a lesson this morning?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never a lesson,&rdquo; said the lad; &ldquo;I was too busy living.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Living, said ye?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Living. I was at the swimming at the Creags, and beaking in the sun on
the braes above the Garron beside the march wall where the hedgehogs
creep, and I am new from the shinty,&rdquo; and he shook the shinty-stick in his
hand.
</p>
<p>
The captain took to pondering, his chin on his hand and his elbows on the
table, where a bottle and glass lay beside him.
</p>
<p>
After a bit he said, &ldquo;Look ye, my son, what are ye meaning to be?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm for the sword-work,&rdquo; the lad said, in a flash, his face twitching.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I would sooner see you in hell first!&rdquo; cried the captain, thumping the
board till the glass rang. He had seen foreign wars himself and had a hack
on the groin.
</p>
<p>
That was the first of the feud between them. They fought it dour and they
fought it hard, the father for the crafts of peace and the lad for his own
way, and at last one day the captain said&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To the door, brat, and your lair with the Boboons you belong to! Faith,
and your grandfather was right when he said there was never a lapdog in a
fox's litter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Who he came of, the lad had no notion, for the swart Macdonalds never came
near the town after Boboon left it for the last time; but he put on his
bonnet, and went out of the house and on to the highroad.
</p>
<p>
It was well on to winter, a brawling day, with the leaves of the Duke's
trees swishing thick and high over the thatch and through the streets of
the Duke's town. Snug stood the gables, friendly and warm, and the
window-lozens winked with the light of big peat-fires within. Over the
breast the seabirds yelped and crows craked without a stop, stirring about
in the branches behind Macvicar's Land. And the salt wind! It blew in from
the low bay at one end of the town and through it to the other, and before
it went a lad into the wide world that starts at the factor's corner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By the shore-side to the low country, or by the woods to the hills?&rdquo; the
lad asked himself. He had the <i>caman</i> still in his hand, and he
tossed it in the air. &ldquo;Bas for the highway, <i>cas</i> for the low,&rdquo; said
he. The shinty fell <i>bos</i>, and our hero took to it for the highway to
the north. He swithered at the Arches, and looked back on the front of the
town and the quay with the oil-lights on it. He was half in the humour to
bide, but he put the notion behind him and stretched to the brae,
whistling a piper's march. At the head of the brae the town houses were
lost to him, and this so soon he could not put up with, so he went down on
a way to the right a little and stood on the grass of the Winterton field.
</p>
<p>
Fast and dark the night was falling, a heavy smirr of rain was drooking
the grass, and the trees on every hand shook the water in blobs from the
branches. Through them the lights of the finest town in the world shone
damp and woe-begone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are good folk in't, and bad folk in't,&rdquo; said the lad to himself;
&ldquo;but somehow 'twas never the place for me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He turned and went into the road through the wood, savage at heart,
without a thought of where his sleep would be. When he came to
Kennachregan, there was the scad of a fire above the trees beside the
roaring river, and he went down and looked over a march dyke at a band of
wanderers under the trees. Young and old, men and women, they lay steaming
on soft beds of springy spruce-branches with their toes to the crackling
logs, snoring as snore sound sleepers, sheltered from the rain by the
thick branches, the side of the hill, and here and there a canvas
covering. There was but one of them up&mdash;a long old man with lank jaws
and black eyes&mdash;John Fine Macdonald. He was stirring up the logs with
the shod of a crutch and humming a Perth song, and before the hottest of
the fire a plucked bird was roasting.
</p>
<p>
The smell of the meat and the wood-fire rose to the dykeside where the lad
stood shivering in his wet clothes, and the comfort of the camp was
something he could not pass by.
</p>
<p>
He took a jump over the dyke and went out in the light of the fire,
wondering what would be his welcome. Old Boboon looked up with his hand
over his eyes, then rose on his crutches and put a hand on the young
fellow's shoulder.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're from Inneraora town?&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said the lad; &ldquo;but it's Inneraora no more for me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; laughed the old wanderer. &ldquo;Sit ye down, ye scamp, and take your
fingers to a pick of your grandfather's hen. Boboon's children may be slow
and far, but home's aye home to them!&rdquo;
 </p>

<h2>
THE FELL SERGEANT.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is ill enough to have to die in Glenaora at any season, but to get the
word for travelling from it on yon trip in the spring of the year is hard
indeed. The gug-gug will halloo in your ears to bid you bide a wee and see
the red of the heather creep on Tom-an-dearc; the soft and sap-scented
winds will come in at the open door, and you will mind, maybe, of a day
long-off and lost when you pulled the copper leaves of the bursting oak
and tossed them among a girl's hair. Oh! the long days and the strong
days! They will come back to you like the curious bit in a tune that is
vexatious and sweet, and not for words or a set thought. You will think of
the lambs on the slopes, of the birds tearing through the thousand ways in
the woods, of the magic hollows in below the thick-sown pines, of the
burns, deep at the bottom of <i>eas</i> and corri, spilling like gold on a
stair. And then, it may be, Solomon Carrier's cart goes by to the town,
the first time since the drifts went off the high road; you hear the
clatter of the iron shoes, and your mind will go with him to the throng
street where the folks are so kind and so free.
</p>
<p>
But to turn your back for the last at that time on Lecknamban must come
sorest of all. For Lecknamban has seven sheilings hidden in its hills,
where the grass is long and juicy, and five burns that are aye on the
giggle like girls at a wedding, and the Aora daunders down in front of the
knowe, full of fish for the Duke alone, but bonny for earl or caird.
</p>
<p>
It was in this same glen, in this same Lecknamban, in the spring of a
year, a woman was at her end. She was a woman up in years but not old, a
black Bana-Mhuileach who had seen pleasant things and trials like all who
come to this queer market-place; but now when the time was come to take
the long road with no convoy, only the good times were in her
recollection. And though Glenaora was not her calf-country (for she came
but a year ago to bide with a friend), she was swear't to turn heel on a
place so cosy.
</p>
<p>
She sat propped up in a box-bed, on pillows, with her face to the open
door, and the friendly airs of the country-side came in to stir her hair.
With them came scents of the red earth and the grass, birch-tree and
myrtle, from the moor. But more than all they brought her who was at her
end a keen craving for one more summer of the grand world. Strong in her
make and dour at the giving-in, she kept talking of the world's affairs
and foolishness to the folk about her who were waiting the Almighty's will
and the coming of the stretching-board. Her fingers picked without a stop
at the woolly bits of the blankets, and her eyes were on as much of the
knowe below the house as she could see out at the open door. It was yellow
at the foot with flowers, and here and there was a spot of blue from the
cuckoo-brogue.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Women, women,&rdquo; she said with short breaths, &ldquo;I'm thinking aye, when I see
the flowers, of a man that came from these parts to Duart. He sang 'Mo
Nighean Dubh' in a style was never heard before in our place, and he once
brought me the scented cuckoo-brogues from Aora.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Said the goodwife, &ldquo;Aoirig, poor woman, it is not the hour for ancient old
<i>sgeuls</i>; be thinking of a canny going.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Going! it was aye going with me,&rdquo; said the woman in the bed. &ldquo;And it was
aye going when things were at their best and I was the keener for them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's the way of God, my dear, <i>ochanie!</i>&rdquo; said one of the two
Tullich sisters, putting a little salt in a plate for-the coming business.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;O God! it's the hard way, indeed. And I'm not so old as you by two or
three clippings.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Peace, Aoirig, heart; you had your own merry times, and that's as much as
most of us have claim to.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Merry times! merry times!&rdquo; said Aoirig, humped among the bedding, her
mind wandering.
</p>
<p>
Curls of the peat-reek coiled from the floor among the <i>cabars</i> or
through the hole in the roof; a lamb ran by the door bleating for its
mother, and the whistling of an <i>uiseag</i> high over the grass where
his nest lay ran out to a thin thread of song. The sound of it troubled
the dying woman, and she asked her friends to shut the door. Now and again
Maisie would put a wet cloth to her lips and dry the death-sweat from her
face. The goodwife was throng among chests and presses looking for sheets,
shrouds, and dead-caps.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's a pity,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you brought no grave-clothes with you from Mull,
my dear.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you grudging me yours?&rdquo; asked Aoirig, coming round from wandering.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, nor grudging; fine ye ken it, cousin. But I know ye have them, and
it's a pity you should be dressed in another's spinning than your own.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, they're yonder sure enough: clean and ready. And there's more than
that beside them. The linen I should have brought to a man's home.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You and your man's home! Is it Duart, my dear, among your own folk, or
down to Inishail, you would have us take you?&rdquo; Aoirig coughed till the red
froth was at her lips.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Duart is homely and Inishail is holy, sure enough, but I would have it
Kilmalieu. They tell me it's a fine kirkyard; but I never had the luck to
see it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's well enough, I'll not deny, and it would not be so far to take you.
Our folk have a space of their own among the MacVicars, below the parson.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The woman in the bed signed for a sip of water, and they had it fast at
her lips.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Could you be putting me near the Macnicols?&rdquo; she asked in a weakening
voice. &ldquo;The one I speak of was a Macnicol.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the goodwife; &ldquo;they were aye gallant among the girls.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Gallant he was,&rdquo; said the one among the blankets. &ldquo;I see him now. The
best man ever I saw. It was at a wedding&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The woman's breast racked and the spume spattered over the home-spun
blankets.
</p>
<p>
Maisie was heating a death-shift at the peat-fire, turning it over in her
hands, letting the dry airs into every seam and corner.
</p>
<p>
Looking at her preparation, the dying woman caught back her breath to ask
why such trouble with a dead-shift.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ye would not have it on damp and cold,&rdquo; said Maisie, settling the
business. &ldquo;I doubt it'll be long in the sleeves, woman, for the goodwife
has a lengthy reach.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was at a marriage in Glenurchy,&rdquo; said Aoirig in a haver, the pillows
slipping down behind her back. &ldquo;Yonder he is. A slim straight lad. Ronnal,
O Ronnal my hero! What a dancer! not his match in Mull. Aye so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A foot could be heard on the road, and one of the two sisters ran out, for
she knew whom it would be. They had sent word to the town by Solomon in
the morning for Macnicol the wright to come up with the stretching-board,
thinking there was but an hour more for poor Macnicol's were the
footsteps, and there he was with the stretching-board under his arm&mdash;a
good piece of larch rubbed smooth by sheet and shroud, and a little hollow
worn at the head. He was a fat man, rolling a bit to one side on a short
leg, gross and flabby at the jowl, and thick-lipped; but he might have
been a swanky lad in his day, and there was a bit of good-humour in the
corner of his eye, where you will never see it when one has been born with
the uneasy mind. He was humming to himself as he came up the brae a
Badenoch ditty they have in these parts on the winter nights, gossiping
round the fire. Whom he was going to stretch he had no notion, except that
it was a woman and a stranger to the glen.
</p>
<p>
The sister took him round to the corner of the house and in at the byre
door, and told him to wait. &ldquo;It'll not be long now,&rdquo; she said.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then she's still to the fore,&rdquo; said the wright. &ldquo;I might have waited on
the paymaster's dram at Three Bridges if I had ken't. Women are aye thrawn
about dying. They'll put it off to the last, when a man would be glad to
be taking the road. Who is she, poor woman?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A cousin-german of Nanny's,&rdquo; said the sister, putting a bottle before
him, and whipping out for some bannock and cheese. He sat down on a
shearing-stool, facing the door, half open, between the byre he was in and
the kitchen where Aoirig was at the dying. The stretching-board leaned
against the wall outside.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Aye so gentle, so kind,&rdquo; the woman in the bed was saying in her last
dover. &ldquo;He kissed me first on a day like this. And the blue flowers from
Aora?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In the byre the wright was preeing the drink and paying little heed to
food. It was the good warm stuff they brew on the side of Lochow, the
heart of the very heart of the barley-fields, with the taste of gall and
peat, and he mellowed with every quaich, and took to the soft lilting of
Niall Ban's song:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;'I am the Sergeant fell but kind
(Ho! ho! heroes, agus ho-e-ro! );
I only lift but the deaf and blind,
The wearied-out and the rest-inclined.
Many a booty I drive before,
Through the glens, through the glens.'
said the Sergeant Mor.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
Ben the house the goodwife was saying the prayers for the dying woman the
woman should have said for herself while she had the wind for it, but
Aoirig harped on her love-tale. She was going fast, and the sisters,
putting their hands to her feet, could feel that they were cold as the
rocks. Maisie's arms were round her, and she seemed to have the notion
that here was the grip of death, for she pushed her back.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not so old&mdash;so old. There is Seana, my neighbour at Duart&mdash;long
past the fourscore and still spinning&mdash;I am not so old&mdash;God of
grace&mdash;so old&mdash;and the flowers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A grey shiver went over her face; her breast heaved and fell in; her voice
stopped with a gluck in the throat.
</p>
<p>
The women stirred round fast in the kitchen. Out on the clay floor the two
sisters pushed the table and laid a sheet on it, the goodwife put aside
the pillows and let Aoirig's head fall back on the bed. Maisie put her
hand to the clock and stopped it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Open the door, open the door!&rdquo; cried the goodwife, turning round in a
hurry and seeing the door still shut.
</p>
<p>
One of the sisters put a finger below the sneck and did as she was told,
to let out the dead one's ghost.
</p>
<p>
Outside, taking the air, to get the stir of the strong waters out of his
head, was the wright.
</p>
<p>
He knew what the opening of the door meant, and he lifted his board and
went in with it under his arm. A wafting of the spring smells came in at
his back, and he stood with his bonnet in his hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So this is the end o't?&rdquo; he said in a soft way, stamping out the fire on
the floor.
</p>
<p>
He had but said it when Eurig sat up with a start in the bed, and the
women cried out. She opened her eyes and looked at the man, with his fat
face, his round back, and ill-made clothes, and the death-deal under his
oxter, and then she fell back on the bed with her face stiffening.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here's the board for ye,&rdquo; said the wright, his face spotted white and his
eyes staring. &ldquo;I'll go out a bit and take a look about me. I once knew a
woman who was terribly like you, and she came from Mull.&rdquo;

<h2>
BLACK MURDO
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Mas breug uam e is breug thugam e.&rdquo;

&mdash;Gaelic Proverb.
</pre>
<h3>
I.
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>LACK MURDO'S wife was heavy, and 'twas the time the little brown nats
were pattering in Stronbuie wood. Stronbuie spreads out its greenness to
the sun from the slope of Cladich. It is, in its season, full of the
piping of birds and the hurry of wings, and the winds of it have the smell
of a fat soil. The Diarmaids were the cunning folk to steal it; for if
Stronshira is good, Stronbuie is better; and though the loops of Aora
tangle themselves in the gardens of the Red Duke, Lochow has enchantment
for the galley of a king. Fraoch Eilean, Innis Chonell, and Innis Chonain&mdash;they
cluster on the bend of it like the gems on a brooch, Inishail of the Monks
makes it holy, and Cruachan-ben, who lords it over Lorn, keeps the cold
north wind from the shore. They may talk of Glenaora, but Stronbuie comes
close, close to the heart!
</p>
<p>
For all that, 'twas on a time a poor enough place for a woman in yon
plight; for the rest of the clan crowded down on Innistiynich, all
fighters and coarse men of the sword, and a skilly woman or a
stretching-board was no nearer than a day's tramp over the hill and down
Aora glen to the walls of Inneraora. If one died on Cladich-side then&mdash;and
'twas a dying time, for the Athol dogs were for ever at the harrying&mdash;it
was but a rough burying, with no corranach and no mort-cloth; if a child
came, it found but cold water and a cold world, whatever hearts might be.
But for seven years no child came for Black Murdo.
</p>
<p>
They say, in the Gaelic old-word, that a stolen bitch will never throw
clean pups nor a home-sick woman giants. Murdo recked nothing of that when
he went wooing in a time of truce to Croit-bhile, the honey-croft that
makes a red patch on the edge of Creag Dubh. He brought Silis home to the
dull place at Stronbuie, and she baked his bannocks and ploughed his bit
of soil, but her heart never left salt Finne-side. In the morning she
would go to the hill to look through the blurred glen, and she would have
made bargains with the ugliest crow that could flap on feathers for a
day's use of his wings. She could have walked it right often and gaily to
her people's place, but Black Murdo was of Clan Artair, and Artairich had
not yet come under the <i>bratach</i> of Diarmaid, and bloody knives made
a march-dyke between the two tartans.
</p>
<p>
Seven years and seven days went by, and Black Murdo, coming in on an
evening after a hard day at the deer, found Silis making the curious wee
clothes. He looked at her keen, questioning, and she bleached to the lips.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said she, breaking a thread with her teeth, and bending till
the peat-flame dyed her neck like wine.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;God, and I'm the stout fellow!&rdquo; said he, and out he went, down all the
way to Portinsherrich, and lusty he was with the ale among the pretty men
there.
</p>
<p>
Weeks chased each other like sheep in a fank, and Silis grew sick at the
heart. There's a time for a woman when the word of a woman is sweeter than
a harp; but there were only foolish girls at Innistrynich, and coarse men
of the sword. So Murdo stayed in from the roes when the time crept close.
To see him do the heavy work of the house and carrying in the peats was a
sorry sight.
</p>
<p>
Silis kept dreaming of Finne-side, where she had heard the long wave in
the spring of the year when she had gone home on a password to a woman's
wedding with Long Coll. The same Long Coll had brothers, and one had put a
man's foolish sayings in her ears before ever she met Murdo, she a thin
girl like a saugh-wand and not eighteen till Beltane. They called him&mdash;no
matter&mdash;and he had the way with the women. Faith, it's the strange
art! It is not looks, nor dancing, nor the good heart, nor wit, but some
soft fire of the eye and maybe a song to the bargain. Whatever it was, it
had Silis, for all that her goodman Murdo had a man's qualities and
honesty extra.
</p>
<p>
They say, &ldquo;<i>Cnuic is sluic is Alpeinich, ach cuin a thàinig Artharaich?</i>&rdquo;(1)
in the by-word; but Artharaich had age enough for a <i>taibhsear</i>
whatever, for Black Murdo had the Sight.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
1  The hills and hollows and Clan Alpine came together, but
when arose Clan Artair?
</pre>
<p>
It's the curious thing to say of a man with all his parts that he should
be <i>taibhsear</i> and see visions; for a <i>taibhsear</i>, by all the
laws, should be an old fellow with little use for swords or shinny-sticks.
But Murdo missed being a full taibhsear by an ell, so the fit had him
seldom. He was the seventh son of a mother who died with the brand of a
cross on her brow, and she was kin to the Glenurchy Woman. And something
crept over him with the days, that put a mist in his eyes when he looked
at Silis; but &ldquo;I'm no real <i>taibhsear</i>,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and I
swear by the black stones it is no cloth. A man with all the Gift might
call it a shroud high on her breast, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Silis, <i>a bhean!</i> shall it be the Skilly Dame of Inneraora?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A light leaped to the woman's eyes, for the very thing was in her mind.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If it could be,&rdquo; she said, slowly; &ldquo;but it's not easy to get her, for
black's your name on Aoraside.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Black or white, Murdo stands in his own shoes. He has been at the gate of
Inneraora when Strong Colin the warder had little thought of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then, oh heart! it must be soon&mdash;tomorrow&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The mouth of day found Silis worse, and Murdo on his way to Inneraora.
</p>
<p>
He stepped it down Glenaora like Coll Mor in the story, or the man with
the fairy shoes. A cloud was over Tullich and a wet wind whistled on
Kennachregan. The man's target played dunt on his back, so hasty was he,
for all that the outposts of Big Colin had hawk's eyes on the pass. He had
got the length of Alt Shelechan when a Diarmaid came out on him from the
bracken with a curse on his mouth. He was a big Diarmaid, high-breasted
and stark, for there's no denying there was breed in the pigs.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ho, ho, lad!&rdquo; said he, crousely, &ldquo;it's risking it you are this day!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Black Murdo's hands went to his sides, where a ready man's should ready
be; but he had sight of Silis. He could see her in Stronbuie in the bothy,
on the wee creepy-stool beside the peats, and he knew she was saying the
Wise Woman's Wish that Diarmaid mothers have so often need of. Length is
length, and it's a far cry to Lochow sure enough; but even half a <i>taibhsear</i>
takes no count of miles and time.
</p>
<p>
He spoke softly. &ldquo;I go to Inneraora for the Skilly Woman. My wife is a
daughter of your folks, and she'll have none but the dame who brought
herself home.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Death or life?&rdquo; asked the Diarmaid, a freckled hand still on the
basket-hilt. He put the question roughly, for nobody likes to lose a ploy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Life it is, my lad. It's not to dress corpses but to wash weans she's
wanted.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ho-chutt!&rdquo; went the blade back against the brass of the scabbard (for he
was <i>duin-uasal</i> who carried it), and the man's face changed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pass!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would not stand in a bairn's way to life. Had it been
shrouds instead of sweelers, we could have had it out, for a corpse is in
no great hurry. But troth it's yourself is the tight one, and I would have
liked a bit of the old game.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No more than Murdo, red fellow!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Murdo! So be't; yet Murdo will give me his dirk for gate-pay, or they'll
be saying farther down that Calum, as good a man, kept out of his way.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The <i>biodag</i> went flying into the grass at Calum's feet, and Murdo
went leaping down the glen. It was like stalking deer for the Diarmaids.
Here and there he had to go into the river or among the hazel-switches, or
crawl on his stomach among the gall.
</p>
<p>
From Kilmune to Uchdan-barracaldine the red fellows were passing, or
playing with the <i>clachneart</i> or the <i>cabar,</i> or watching their
women toiling in the little fields.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thorns in their sides!&rdquo; he said to himself, furious at last, when another
keen-eyed Diarmaid caught sight of his tartan and his black beard among
some whins. It was a stripling with only a dirk, but he could gather fifty
men on the crook of his finger.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stand!&rdquo; cried the Diarmaid, flashing the dirk out. &ldquo;What want ye so far
over this way?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Murdo, even in the rage, saw Silis, a limp creature, sweating in her
pains, her black eyes (like the sloe) keen on the door. So close, so sure,
so sorrowful! He could have touched her on the shoulder and whispered in
her ear.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am Black Murdo,&rdquo; he told the lad. &ldquo;I am for Inneraora for the Skilly
Woman for my wife, child of your own clan.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Death or life?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Tis a bonny targe ye have, man; it might be doing for toll.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The lad got it, and Murdo went on his way. He found the Skilly Woman, who
put before him sour milk and brose. But he would not have drink or sup, so
back through the Diarmaids they went without question (for the woman's
trade was as good as the chief's convoy), till they came to Tom-an-dearc.
Out upon them there a fellow red and pretty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; he said, as if it had been dogs. &ldquo;What's the name of ye, black
fellow?&rdquo; Murdo cursed in his beard. &ldquo;My name's honest man, but I have not
time to prove it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Troth that's a pity. But seeing there's the <i>caüleach</i> with you, you
must e'en go your way. There's aye some of you folk on the
stretching-board. Ye want heart, and ye die with a flaff of wind. Lend me
your sword, <i>'ille!</i>''
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Squint-mouth!&rdquo; cried Murdo, &ldquo;your greedy clan took too much off me this
day already for me to part with the sweetest blade Gow-an-aora ever beat
on iron. I took it from one of your cowards at Carnus, and if it's back it
goes, it's not with my will.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then it's the better man must have it,&rdquo; said the red fellow, and, Lord,
he was the neat-built one! They took off their coats, and for lack of
bucklers rolled them round their arms, both calm and canny. The Diarmaid
was first ready with his brand out, and Murdo put to his point. For a
little the two men stood, spread out, hard-drawn behind the knees, with
the cords of the neck like thongs, then at it with a clatter of steel.
</p>
<p>
The Skilly Woman, with the plaid pulled tight over her grey hair, sat with
sunk eyes on a stone and waited without wonder. She had sons who had died
in brawls at Kilmichael market, or in the long foray far in Kintail; and
her man, foster-brother to a chief, got death in the strange foreign wars,
where the pay was not hide and horn but round gold.
</p>
<p>
A smoky soft smirr of rain filled all the gap between the hills, though
Sithean Sluaidhe and Dunchuach had tips of brass from a sun dropping
behind the Salachary hills. The grass and the gall lost their glitter and
became grey and dull; the hill of Lecknamban, where five burns are born,
coaxed the mist down on its breast like a lover. It was wet, wet, but
never a drop made a rush bend or a leaf fall. Below the foot the ground
was greasy, as it is in a fold at the dippingtime; but the two men pulled
themselves up with a leap on it as if it might be dry sand, and the
brogues made no error on the soil.
</p>
<p>
First the Diarmaid pressed, for he had it over the other man in youth, and
youth is but tame when it's slow or slack. Murdo waited, all eyes that
never blinked, with the basket well up, and kept on his toes. &ldquo;Splank,
sp-ll-ank, sp-ll-ank&mdash;<i>siod e</i>!&rdquo; said the blades, and the
Diarmaid's for a time made the most of the music, but he never got inside
the black fellow's guard. Then Murdo took up the story with a snap of the
teeth, skelping hard at the red one till the hands dirled in the basket
like a bag of pins. The smirr gathered thicker, and went to rain that fell
solid, the brogues grew like steeped bladders on the feet, a scatter of
crows made a noisy homing to the trees at Tullich, and Aora gobbled like
swine in a baron's trough.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Haste ye, heroes,&rdquo; said the old woman, cowering on the wet stone; &ldquo;haste
ye, dears; it's mighty long ye are about it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Diarmaid turned the edge twice on the coated arm, and Murdo wasted his
wind to curse. Then he gave the stroke that's worth fifty head of kyloes
(fine they know that same all below Cladichl), and a red seam jumped to
the Diarmaid's face. All his heart went to stiffen his slacking heavy arm,
and he poured on Murdo till Murdo felt it like a rain of spears. One hot
wandering stroke he got on the bonnet, and for want of the bowl of brose
at Inneraora, the wind that should go to help him went inside, and turned
his stomach. Sweat, hot and salt, stung his eyes, his ears filled with a
great booming, he fell in a weary dream of a far-off fight on a witched
shore, with the waves rolling, and some one else at the fencing, and
caring nought, but holding guard with the best blade Gow-an-aora ever took
from flame. Back stepped the Diarmaid, sudden, and sweep went his steel at
the shaking knees.
</p>
<p>
A bairn's cry struck Murdo's ear through the booming and sent him full
awake. He drew back the stretched foot fast, and round the red one's sword
hissed through air. &ldquo;Foil! foil!&rdquo; said Murdo, and he slashed him on the
groin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That'll do, man; no more,&rdquo; said the Skilly Woman, quickly,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I may as well finish him; it's lame he'll be all his days any way, and
little use is a man with a halt in a healthy clan.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Halt or no halt, let him be; he's my second cousin's son.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Murdo looked for a bit at the bloody thing before him, but the woman
craved again with bony fingers on his wrist; so he spat on the dirty green
tartan and went. The smoke rose from him and hung about with a smell of
wearied flesh, the grey of the mist was black at Carnus. When the pair
came over against Lochow, where one can see the holy isle when it is day,
the night was deep and cold; but the woman bent at the cross with a &ldquo;<i>Mhoire
Mhathair</i>,&rdquo; and so did the man, picking the clotted blood from his ear.
They dropped down the brae on the house at last.
</p>
<p>
For a little Black Murdo's finger hung on the sneck, and when he heard a
sound he pushed in the door.
</p>
<p>
All about the house the peat-reek swung like mist on the mountain. Wind
and rain fought it out on Cladich brae, and when it was not the wind that
came bold through the smoke-hole in the roof, 'twas the rain, a beady
slant that hissed on the peats like roasting herrings. The woman lay slack
on the bed, her eyes glossed over with the glass that folks see the great
sights through, and her fingers making love over the face and breast of a
new-born boy that cried thinly at her knees. A lighted cruisie spluttered
with heavy smell at the end of a string on a rafter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;O Skilly Woman, Skilly Woman, it's late we are,&rdquo; said Black Murdo.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Late enough, as ye say, just man. Had ye bartered an old sword for twenty
minutes on the Tom-an-dearc, I was here before danger.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then the Skilly Woman set him on the wet windy side of the door, and went
about with busy hands.
</p>
<p>
The man, with the ragged edge of his kilt scraping his knees and the rain
bubbling in his brogues, leaned against the wattled door and smeared the
blood from his brow. A cold wind gulped down from Glenurchy and ghosts
were over Inishail. The blast whirled about and whirled about, and swung
the rowan like a fern, and whistled in the gall, and tore the thatch, all
to drown a child's cry. The blackness crowded close round like a wall, and
flapped above like a plaid&mdash;Stronbuie was in a tent and out of the
world. Murdo strained to hear a voice, but the wind had the better of him.
He went round to the gable, thinking to listen at the window, but the
board on the inside shut the wind and him out. The strange emptiness of
grief was in his belly.
</p>
<p>
Inside, the Skilly One went like a witch, beak-nosed and half-blind. There
was clatter of pans and the dash of water, the greeting of the child and
the moan of the mother. What else is no man's business. For all she was
skilly the old dame had no thought of the woman sinking.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You'll have blithe-meat in the morning,&rdquo; she said, cheerily, from the
fireside.
</p>
<p>
Silis made worse moan than before.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Such a boy, white love! And hair like the copper! His hide is mottled
like a trout's back; calf of my heart!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Silis, on her side, put out white craving arms. &ldquo;Give it to me, wife; give
it to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wheesht! rest ye, dear, rest ye,&rdquo; said the Skilly Dame.
</p>
<p>
But she put the bairn in its mother's arms. Silis, when she had it on her
breast, sobbed till the bed shook.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is not he the hero, darling?&rdquo; said the Skilly Woman. &ldquo;It's easy seen he's
off Clan Diarmaid on one side, for all that yoar hair is black as the
sloe. Look at the colour of him!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Fright was in the mother's face. &ldquo;Come close, come close till I tell you,&rdquo;
 she said, her long hair damp on her milky shoulders.
</p>
<p>
The Skilly Woman put down her head and listened with wonder.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Me-the-day! Was I not the blind one to miss it? His name, white love? No
one shall ken it from me, not even Murdo.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A man's name took up the last breath of Silis; she gave a little shiver,
and choked with a sound that the old crone had heard too often not to
know.
</p>
<p>
She looked, helpless, for a little at the bed, then felt the mother's
feet. They were as cold as stone.
</p>
<p>
A cry caught Murdo's ear against the wattles, and he drove in the door
with his shoulder, heeding no sneck nor bar.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am not I the blind fool?&rdquo; said the crone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's your wife gone, cheap enough at the price of a yard of steel.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They stood and looked at the bed together, the bairn crying without
notice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; said the man, heaving; &ldquo;<i>taibhsear</i> half or whole, I
could see the shroud on her neck!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The grey light was drifting in from Cladich. The fir-trees put stretched
fingers up against the day, and Murdo was placing a platter of salt on a
bosom as cold and as white as the snow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're feeding him on the wrong cloth,&rdquo; said he, seeing the crone give
suck to the child from a rag of Diarmaid tartan dipped in goat's milk.
</p>
<h3>
II.
</h3>
<p>
The boy grew like a tree in a dream, that is seed, sapling, and giant in
one turn on the side. Stronbuie's wattled bothy, old and ugly, quivered
with his laughing, and the young heather crept closer round the door. The
Spotted Death filled Inishail with the well-fed and the warm-happed; but
the little one, wild on the brae, forgotten, sucking the whey from rags
and robbing the bush of its berries, gathered sap and sinew like the child
of kings. It is the shrewd way of God! There was bloody enough work forby,
for never a sheiling passed but the brosey folks came pouring down
Glenstrae, scythe, sword, and spear, and went back with the cattle before
them, and redness and smoke behind. But no raider put hand on Black Murdo,
for now he was <i>taibhsear</i> indeed, and the <i>taibhsear</i> has magic
against dub or steel. How he became <i>taibhsear</i> who can be telling?
When he buried Silis out on the isle, his heart grew heavy, gloom seized
him, the cut of the Diarmaid's sword gave a quirk to his brain that
spoiled him for the world's use. He took to the hills no more in sport, he
carried Gow-an-aora's sword no more in battle, for all that it cost him so
dear. A poor man's rig was his at the harvest because of his Gift, and the
cailzie cock or the salmon never refused his lure.
</p>
<p>
Skill of the daymore, the seven cuts, and yon ready slash worth fifty head
of kyloes, he gave to the boy, and then the quick cunning parry, and the
use of the foot and knee that makes half a swordsman.
</p>
<p>
But never a spot of crimson would he have on Rory's steel.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;First dip in the blood of the man with the halt, and then farewell to
ye!&rdquo; he said, wearying for the day when the boy should avenge his mother.
</p>
<p>
Folks&mdash;far-wandered ones&mdash;brought him news of the man with the
halt that was his giving, the Diarmaid whose bargain for a sword on
Tom-an-dearc cost Silis her life. He passed it on to the boy, and he
filled him with old men's tales. He weaved the cunning stories of the pigs
of Inneraora, for all that the boy's mother came from their loins, and he
made them&mdash;what there may well be doubts of&mdash;cowards and weak.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They killed your mother, Rory: her with the eyes like the sloe and the
neck like snow. Swear by the Holy Iron that the man with the halt we ken
of gets his pay for it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Rory swore on the iron. It is an easy thing for one when the blood is
strong and the <i>biodag</i> still untried. He lay awake at night,
thinking of his mother's murderer till the sweat poured. He would have
been on the track of him before ever he had won his man's bonnet by
lifting the <i>clach-cuid-fear</i>, but Murdo said, &ldquo;Let us be sure. You
are young yet, and I have one other trick of fencing worth while biding
for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At last, upon a time, Murdo found the boy could match himself, and he
said, &ldquo;Now let us to this affair.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He took the boy, as it were, by the hand, and they ran up the hills and
down the hills, and through the wet glens, to wherever a Diarmaid might
be; and where were they not where strokes were going? The hoodie-crow was
no surer on the scent of war. Blar-na-leine took them over the six valleys
and the six mountains; Cowal saw them on the day the Lamonts got their
bellyful; a knock came on them on the night when the Stewarts took their
best from Appin and flung themselves on Inneraora, and they went out
without a word and marched with that high race.
</p>
<p>
But luck was with the man with the halt they sought for. At muster for
raid, or at market, he was there, swank man and pretty but for the
lameness he had found on an ill day on Tom-an-dearc. He sang songs round
the ale with the sweetness of the bird, and his stories came ready enough
off the tongue. Black Murdo and the boy were often close enough on his
heel, but he was off and away like the corp-candle before they were any
nigher. If he had magic, it could have happened no stranger.
</p>
<p>
Once, a caird who went round the world with the jingle of cans on his back
and a sheaf of withies in his oxter, told them that a lame Diarmaid was
bragging at Kilmichael fair that he would play single-stick for three days
against the country-side. They sped down to Ford, and over the way; but
nothing came of it, for the second day had found no one to come to the
challenge, and the man with the halt was home again.
</p>
<p>
Black Murdo grew sick of the chase, and the cub too tired of it. For his
father's fancy he was losing the good times&mdash;many a fine exploit
among the Atholmen and the brosey folks of Glenstrae; and when he went
down to Innistrynich to see the lads go out with belt and plaid, he would
give gold to be with them.
</p>
<p>
One day, &ldquo;I have dreamed a dream,&rdquo; said Murdo, &ldquo;Our time is come: what we
want will be on the edge of the sea, and it will be the third man after
dawn. Come, son, let us make for Inneraora.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Inneraora lies now between the bays, sleeping day and night, for the old
times are forgot and the nettle's on Dunchuach. Before the plaid of
MacCailein Mor was spread from Cowal to Cruachan, it was the stirring
place; high and dry on the bank of Slochd-a-chubair, and the dogs
themselves fed on buck-flesh from the mountains, so rowth the times! One
we ken of has a right to this place or that place yonder that shall not be
named, and should hold his head as high on Aora as any chief of the boar's
snout; but <i>mo thruaigh! mo thruaigh!</i> the black bed of Macartair is
in the Castle itself, and Macartair is without soil or shield. How
Diarmaid got the old place is a sennachie's tale. &ldquo;As much of the land as
a heifer's hide will cover,&rdquo; said the foolish writing, and MacCailein had
the guile to make the place his own. He cut the hide of a long-backed
heifer into thin thongs, and stretched it round Stronbuie. There is day
about to be seen with his race for that! Over to Inneraora then went
Murdo, and Rory clad for fighting, bearing with him the keen old sword.
'Twas a different time going down the glen then from what it was on the
misty day Murdo fetched the Skilly Dame; for the Diarmaids he met by the
way said, &ldquo;'Tis the Lochow <i>taibhsear</i> and his tail,&rdquo; and let them by
without a word, or maybe with a salute. They went to the Skilly Dame's
house, and she gave them the Gael's welcome, with bannocks and crowdie, <i>marag-dkubh</i>
and ale. But she asked them not their business, for that is the way of the
churl. She made them soft-scented beds of white hay in a dirty black
corner, where they slept till cockcrow with sweet weariness in their
bones.
</p>
<p>
The morning was a grey day with frost and snow. Jumping John's bay below
the house was asleep with a soft smoke like a blanket over it. Lean deer
from behind the wood came down trotting along the shore, sniffing the
saltness, and wondering where the meat was. With luck and a good <i>sgian-dubh</i>
a quick lad could do some gralloching. The tide was far out from Ard
Rannoch to the Gallows-tree, and first there was the brown wrack, and then
there was the dun sand, and on the edge of the sand a bird went stalking.
The old man and the young one stood at the gable and looked at it all.
</p>
<p>
It was a short cut from below the castle to the point of Ard Rannoch, if
the tide was out, to go over the sand. &ldquo;What we wait on,&rdquo; said Murdo,
softly, &ldquo;goes across there. There will be two men, and them ye shall not
heed, but the third is him ye ken of. Ye'll trap him between the whin-bush
and the sea, and there can be no escaping unless he takes to the swimming
for it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Rory plucked his belts tight, took out the good blade wondrous quiet,
breathing fast and heavy. The rich blood raced up his back, and tingled
hot against his ruddy neck.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What seest thou, my son?&rdquo; said Murdo at last.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A man with a quick step and no limp,&rdquo; quoth the lad.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let him pass.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then again said the old man, &ldquo;What seest thou?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A <i>bodach</i> frail and bent, with a net on his shoulder,&rdquo; said Rory.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let him pass.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The sun went high over Ben Ime, and struck the snow till the eyes were
blinded. Rory rubbed the sweat from his drenched palm on the pleat of his
kilt, and caught the basket-hand tighter. Over Aora mouth reek went up
from a fishing-skiff, and a black spot stood out against the snow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What seest thou now, lad?&rdquo; asked Murdo.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The man with the halt,&rdquo; answered the lad.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then your time has come, child. The stroke worth the fifty head, and pith
on your arm!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Rory left the old man's side, and went down through a patch of shelisters,
his mouth dry as a peat and his heart leaping. He was across the wrack and
below the pools before the coming man had noticed him. But the coming man
thought nothing wrong, and if he did, it was but one man at any rate, and
one man could use but one sword, if swords were going. Rory stepped on the
edge of the sand, and tagged the bonnet down on his brow, while the man
limped on between him and the sea. Then he stepped out briskly and said,
&ldquo;Stop, pig!&rdquo; He said it strangely soft, and with, as it were, no heart in
the business; for though the lame man was strong, deepbreasted, supple,
and all sound above the belt, there was a look about him that made the
young fellow have little keenness for the work.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pig?&rdquo; said the Diarmaid, putting back his shoulders and looking under his
heavy brows. &ldquo;You are the Lochow lad who has been seeking for me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ho, ho! red fellow; ye kent of it, then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Red fellow! It's red enough you are yourself, I'm thinking. I have no
great heed to draw steel on a lad of your colour, so I'll just go my way.&rdquo;
 And the man looked with queer wistful eyes over his shoulder at the lad,
who, with blade-point on the sand, would have let him pass.
</p>
<p>
But up-by at the house the <i>taibhsear</i> watched the meeting. The quiet
turn it took was beyond his reading, for he had thought it would be but
the rush, and the fast fall-to, and no waste of time, for the tide was
coming in.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;White love, give him it!&rdquo; he cried out, making for the shore. &ldquo;He looks
lame, but the pig's worth a man's first fencing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Up went the boy's steel against the grey cloud, and he was at the throat
of the Diarmaid like a beast. &ldquo;Malison on your black heart, murderer!&rdquo; he
roared, still gripping his broadsword. The Diarmaid flung him off like a
child, and put up his guard against the whisking of his blade.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, foolish boy!&rdquo; he panted wofully as the lad pressed, and the grey
light spread over sea and over shore. The quiet tide crawled in about
their feet; birds wheeled on white feathers with mocking screams; the old
man leaned on his staff and cheered the boy. The Diarmaid had all the
coolness and more of art, and he could have ended the play as he wanted.
But he only fended, and at last the slash worth fifty head found his neck.
He fell on his side, with a queer twisted laugh on his face, saying,
&ldquo;Little hero, ye fence&mdash;ye fence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Haste ye, son! finish the thing!&rdquo; said the <i>taibhsear,</i> all shaking,
and the lad did as he was told, hocking at the spurt the blood made. He
was pushing his dirk in the sand to clean it, when his eye fell on the
Skilly Woman hirpling nimbly down to the shore. She was making a loud cry.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;God I God! it's the great pity about this,&rdquo; said she, looking at Murdo
cutting the silver buttons off the corpse's jacket. &ldquo;Ken ye the man that's
there dripping?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The man's no more,&rdquo; said Rory, cool enough. &ldquo;He has gone travelling, and
we forgot to ask his name.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then if happy you would be, go home to Lochow, and ask it not, nor aught
about him, if you wouldn't rue long. You sucked your first from a Diarmaid
rag, and it was not for nothing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Murdo drew back with a clumsy start from the dead man's side and looked
down on his face, then at the boy's, queerly. &ldquo;I am for off,&rdquo; said he at
last with a sudden hurry. &ldquo;You can follow if you like, red young one.&rdquo; And
he tossed the dead man's buttons in Rory's face!

<h2>
THE SEA-FAIRY OF FRENCH FORELAND.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NCE I saw a fairy King, and it was in the Castle up-by. The Castle took
fire, and a fine blaze it made at the foot of Dunchaach. A boy, I ran with
the rest to carry out the MacCailein's rich gear, and behold! I wandered
and lost my way in that large place where is a window for every day in the
year. Up the long stairs and through the far passages, and over the
shining sounding floors went I, barefoot, with a feared eye on every hole
and corner. At every door it was, &ldquo;Surely now I'm with the folks at the
fire&rdquo;; but every door was a way into a quieter quietness, and the Castle
was my own. I sat at last on a black chair that had a curious twisted
back, and the tears went raining on the lap of my kilt.
</p>
<p>
Long, long I sat, and sore I grat, my mind full, not so much of my way
lost, but of the bigness of things, and the notion of what it would be to
have to live in a castle at night, with doors on every hand for ghosts to
rap at, and crooked passages without end for gowsty winds to moan in.
Thinks I, &ldquo;The smallest hut in the town for me, with all plain before me,
with the one door shut and my face to it, and the candlelight seeking into
every crack and cranny!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was then that the fairy King came on me out of the sewed cloth hanging
on the wall.
</p>
<p>
He was a dainty wee man, in our own tartan, with a steel plate on his
breast baronly-style, and strange long curly hair. I ran my wet eyes down
seven silver buttons the shape of salmon on the front of his vest before I
let myself go, but go I must, so I put fast heels on my fright. I galloped
with a frozen tongue through miles of the Duke's castle till a door
brought me out on the grass of Cairnban, in front of the friendly bleeze
that my own folks were pouring the stoups of water on.
</p>
<p>
That was the only time the quiet folk and I came to a meeting, though our
family was always gleg at seeing things. A cousin-german once saw the
fairy bull that puts up in Loch Steallaire-bhan behind the town. It came
on a jaunt to the glen in the guise of a rich maiden, and my cousin, the
son of the house, made love to her. One night&mdash;in a way that I need
not mention&mdash;he found himself in her room combing down her yellow
hair, and what was among her hair but fine sand that told the whole story?
&ldquo;You are a <i>gruagach</i> of the lake!&rdquo; cried the lad, letting the comb
drop on the floor, with his face white, and the thing tarned to its own
shape and went bellowing to the shore.
</p>
<p>
And there was a man&mdash;blessings with him! for he's here no more&mdash;who
would always be going up on Sithean Sluaidhe to have troke with the wee
people on that fine knowe. He would bring them tastings of honey and
butter to put them in a good key, and there they would dance by the hour
for his diversion to the piping of a piper who played on drones of grass
with reeds made of the midge's thrapple.
</p>
<p>
Still, in all my time I know but one body who could find the way to the
den of the Sea-Fairies, and she was a lass whose folks were in Ceannmor at
the time the French traffickers were coming here to swap casks of claret
wine for the finest herrings in the wide world.
</p>
<p>
It was her custom to go down on the hot days to the shore at the
Water-foot when the tide was far out, and the sand was crusting with salt
in the sun, and the wrack-balls burst with the heat, and the water lay
flat like oil, and lazy, for want of a breath of wind. Sometimes it would
be the French Foreland she would seek, and sometimes Dalchenna; but when
the Frenchmen were at the Foreland she kept clear of it by the counsel of
a cautious father.
</p>
<p>
Up the loch they would sail, the Frenchmen, in their gabberts, and hove-to
with their casks to change for the cured herrings. A curious people they
were, not much like our own good Gaels in many a way, but black-avised and
slim; still with some of the Gael's notions about them too, such as the
humour of fighting and drinking and scouring the countryside for girls.
</p>
<p>
But it happened that one year they left behind them only a wine of
six-waters, and did some other dirty tricks forbye, and there was for long
a feud, so that the Frenchmen behooved to keep to their boats and bargain
with the curers over the gun'le.
</p>
<p>
On a day at that time, Marseli that I speak of had been bathing at the
Ceannmor rocks&mdash;having a crave for salt water the Ceannmor folks
nowadays are not very namely for. When she had her gown on again, she went
round to Dalchenna sands and out far to the edge of the tide, where she
sat on a stone and took to the redding of her hair, that rolled in copper
waves before the comb&mdash;rich, thick, and splendid.
</p>
<p>
Before her, the tide was on the turn so slow and soft that the edge of it
lifted the dry sand like meal. All about on the weedy stones the
tailor-tartans leaped like grasshoppers, the spout-fish stuck far out of
the sand and took a fresh gloss on their shells from the sun.
</p>
<p>
You might seek from shire to shire for a handsomer maid. She was at the
age that's a father's heartbreak, rounding out at the bosom and mellowing
at the eyes; her skin was like milk, and the sigh was at her lips as often
as the song. But though she sighed, it was not for the Ceannmor fishermen,
coarse-bearded, and rough in their courting; for she had vanity, from her
mother's side, and queer notions. The mother's family had been rich in
their day, with bards and thoughtful people among them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If a sea-fairy could see me now,&rdquo; said Marseli, &ldquo;it might put him in the
notion to come this way again,&rdquo; and she started to sing the child-song&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Little folk, little folk, come to me,
From the lobbies that lie below the sea.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>So agad el</i>&rdquo; cried a gull at her back, so plainly that she tamed
fast to look, and there was the fairy before her!
</p>
<p>
Up got Marseli, all shaking and ready to fly, but the fairy-man looked
harmless enough as he bowed low to her, and she stayed to put her hair
behind her ears and draw her gown closer.
</p>
<p>
He was a little delicate man the smallest of Marseli's brothers could have
put in his oxter, with close curled hair, and eyes as black as Ridir
Lochiel's waistcoat. His clothes were the finest of the fine,
knee-breeches with silk hose, buckled brogues, a laced jacket, and a
dagger at his belt&mdash;no more like a fairy of the knowe than the green
tree's like the gall.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're quick enough to take a girl at her word,&rdquo; said Marseli, cunning
one, thinking to hide from him the times and times she had cried over the
sands for the little sea-folks to come in with the tide.
</p>
<p>
The fairy-man said something in his own tongue that had no sense for the
girl, and he bowed low again, with his bonnet waving in his hand, in the
style of Charlie Munn the dancer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must speak in the Gaelic,&rdquo; said Marseli, still a bit put about; &ldquo;or
if you have not the Gaelic, I might be doing with the English, though
little I care for it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; said the fairy-man, &ldquo;I have not the Gaelic, more's the pity, but
I know enough English to say you're the prettiest girl ever I set eyes on
since I left my own place.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
(Ho! hoi was he not the cunning one? The fairies for me for gallantry!)
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;One of such judgment can hardly be uncanny,&rdquo; thought Marseli, so she
stayed and cracked with him in the English tongue.
</p>
<p>
The two of them walked up over the sand to the birch-trees, and under the
birches the little fellow asked Marseli to sit down.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are bigger than I looked for in a sea-fairy,&rdquo; said she when the crack
was a little bit on.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A fairy?&rdquo; said the little fellow, looking at her in the flash of an eye.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes! Though I said just now that you took one fast at her word, the truth
to tell is, that always when the tide went out I sang at your back-doors
the song you heard to-day for the first time. I learned it from Beann
Francie in the Horse Park.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The stranger had a merry laugh&mdash;not the roar of a Finne fisherman&mdash;and
a curions way of hitching the shoulders, and the laugh and the
shoulder-hitch were his answer for Marseli.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You'll be a king in the sea&mdash;in your own place&mdash;or a prince
maybe,&rdquo; said the girl, twisting rushes in her hand.
</p>
<p>
The man gave a little start and got red at the face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who in God's name said so?&rdquo; asked he, looking over her shoulder deep into
the little birch-wood, and then uneasy round about him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I guessed it,&rdquo; said Marseli. &ldquo;The kings of the land-fairies are
by-ordinar big, and the dagger is ever on their hips.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, indeed,&rdquo; said the little fellow, &ldquo;to say I was king were a bravado,
but I would not be just denying that I might be Prince.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And that way their friendship began.
</p>
<p>
At the mouth of many nights when the fishing-boats were off at the
fishing, or sometimes even by day when her father and her two brothers
were chasing the signs of sea-pig and scart far down on Tarbert, Marseli
would meet her fairy friend in a cunning place at the Black-water-foot,
where the sea puts its arms well around a dainty waist of lost land. Here
one can see Loch Finne from Ardno to Strathlachlan: in front lift the long
lazy Cowal hills, and behind is Auchnabreac wood full of deer and birds.
Nowadays the Duke has his road round about this cunning fine place, but
then it lay forgotten among whins that never wanted bloom, and thick,
soft, salty grass. Two plantings of tall trees kept the wind off, and the
centre of it beaked in warm suns. It was like a garden standing out upon
the sea, cut off from the throng road at all tides by a cluster of salt
pools and an elbow of the Duglas Water.
</p>
<p>
Here the Sea-Fairy was always waiting for the girl, walking up and down in
one or other of the tree clumps. He had doffed his fine clothes after
their first meeting for plain ones, and came douce and soberly, but aye
with a small sword on his thigh.
</p>
<p>
The girl knew the folly of it; but tomorrow was always to be the last of
it, and every day brought new wonders to her. He fetched her rings once,
of cunning make, studded with, stones that tickled the eye in a way the
cairngorm and the Cromalt pearl could never come up to.
</p>
<p>
She would finger them as if they were the first blaeberries of a season
and she was feared to spoil their bloom, and in a rapture the Sea-Fairy
would watch the sparkle of eyes that were far before the jewels.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do your folk wear these?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now and then,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;now and then. Ours is a strange family:
to-day we may have the best and the richest that is going, to-morrow who
so poor, without a dud to our backs and a mob crying for our heads?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ochanorie!</i> They are the lovely rings any way.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They might be better; they would need to be much better, my dear, to be
good enough for you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;For me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They're yours&mdash;for a kiss or two,&rdquo; and he put out an arm to wind
round the girl's waist.
</p>
<p>
Marseli drew back and put up her chin and down her brows.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'<i>Stad!</i>&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We ken the worth of fairy gifts in these
parts. Your rings are, likely enough, but chuckie-stones if I could but
see them. Take them back, I must be going home.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The little man took the jewels with a hot face and a laugh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Troth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the same fal-fals have done a lover's business with
more credit to them before this. There are dames in France who would give
their souls for them&mdash;and the one they belong to.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have travelled?&rdquo; said Marseli. &ldquo;Of course a sea-fairy-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can travel as he likes. You are not far wrong, my dear. Well, well, I ken
France! O France, France! round and about the cold world, where's your
equal?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
His eyes filled with tears, and the broad-cloth on his breast heaved
stormily, and Marseli saw that here was some sad thinking.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell me of Fairydom,&rdquo; said she, to change him off so dull a key.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Tis the same, the same. France and fairyland, 'tis the same, self-same,
madame,&rdquo; said the sea-prince, with a hand on his heart and a bow.
</p>
<p>
He started to tell her of rich and rolling fields, flat and juicy, waving
to the wind; of country houses lost and drowned among flowers. &ldquo;And all
the roads lead one way,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to a great and sparkling town. Rain or
shine, there is comfort, and there is the happy heart! The windows open on
the laughing lanes, and the girls lean out and look after us, who prance
by on our horses. There is the hollow hearty hoof-beat on the causey
stones; in the halls the tables gleam with silver and gold; the round red
apples roll over the platter among the slim-stemmed wine-beakers. It is
the time of soft talk and the head full of gallant thoughts. Then there
are the nights warm and soft, when the open doors let out the laughing and
the gliding of silk-shooned feet, and the airs come in heavy with the
scent of breckan and tree!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;On my word,&rdquo; said Marseli, &ldquo;but it's like a girl's dream!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You may say it, black-eyes, <i>mo chridhe!</i> The wonder is that folk
can be found to live so far astray from it. Let me tell you of the
castles.&rdquo; And he told Marseli of women sighing at the harp for
far-wandered ones, or sewing banners of gold. Trumpets and drums and the
tall chevaliers going briskly by with the jingle of sword on heel on the
highway to wars, every chevalier his love and a girl's hands warm upon his
heart.
</p>
<p>
That night Marseli went early abed to wander in fairydom.
</p>
<p>
Next day the sea-gentleman had with him a curious harp that was not
altogether a harp, and was hung over the neck by a ribbon.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What hast here?&rdquo; asked Marseli.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A salve for a sore heart, lass! I can play on it some old tunes, and by
the magic of it I'm back in my father's home and unafeared.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He drew his white fingers over the strings and made a thin twittering of
music sweeter than comes from the <i>clarsach</i>-strings, but foreign and
uncanny. To Marseli it brought notions of far-off affairs, half sweet,
half sad, like the edges of dreams and the moods that come on one in
loneliness and strange places, and one tune he played was a tune she had
heard the French traffickers sing in the bay in the slack seasons.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me sing you a song,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;all for yourself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are bard?&rdquo; she said, with a pleased face.
</p>
<p>
He said nothing, but touched on the curious harp, and sang to the girl's
eyes, to the spark of them and the dance of them and the deep thought
lurking in their corners, to her lips crimson like the rowan and curled
with pride, to the set of breast and shoulder, and the voice melting on
the tongue.
</p>
<p>
It was all in the tune and the player's looks, for the words were fairy to
the girl, but so plain the story, her face burned, and her eyes filled
with a rare confusion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Tis the enchantment of fairydom,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Am not I the <i>oinseach</i>
to listen? I'll warrant yon have sung the same to many a poor girl in all
airts of the world?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The little one laughed and up with the shoulders. &ldquo;On my sword,&rdquo; quo' he,
&ldquo;I could be content to sing to you and France for all my time. Wilt come
with a poor Prince on a Prince's honour?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He kissed her with hot lips; his breath was in her hair; enchantment fell
on her like a plaid, but she tore herself away and ran home, his craving
following at her heels.
</p>
<p>
That night Marseli's brothers came to knives with the French traffickers,
and the morning saw the black-avised ones sailing out over-sea for home.
Back to French Foreland they came no more, and Finne-side took to its own
brewing for lack of the red wine of France.
</p>
<p>
That, too, was the last of the Sea-Fairy.
</p>
<p>
Marseli went to the Water-foot and waited, high tide and low; she cried
the old child tune and she redded her hair, but never again the little man
with the dainty clothes, and the sword upon his thigh.

<h2>
SHUDDERMAN SOLDIER
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>EYOND the Beannan is the Bog of the Fairy-Maid, and a stone-put farther
is the knowe where Shudderman Soldier died in the snow. He was a half-wit
who was wise enough in one thing, for he knew the heart of a maid, and the
proof of it came in the poor year, when the glen gathered its com in
boats, and the potato-shaws were black when they burst the ground, and the
catechist's horse came home by Dhuloch-side to a widow that reckoned on no
empty saddle. And this is the story.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ho, ho, suas e!</i>&rdquo; said the nor' wind, and the snow, and the black
frost, as they galloped down Glenaora like a leash of strong dogs. It was
there was the pretty business! The Salachary hills lost their sink and
swell in the great drifts that swirled on them in the night; the dumb
white swathes made a cold harvest on the flats of Kilmune; the frost
gripped tight at the throats of the burns, and turned the Salmon-Leap to a
stack of silver lances. A cold world it was, sure enough, at the mouth of
day! The bloodshot sun looked over Ben Ime for a little, and that was the
last of him. The sheep lay in the shoulder of the hill with the drift many
a crook's-length above them, and the cock-of-the-mountain and the white
grouse, driven on the blast, met death with a blind shock against the edge
of the larch-wood.
</p>
<p>
Up from Lochow, where Kames looks over to Cruachan, and Cruachan cocks his
grey cap against Lorn, a foolish lad came that day for a tryst that was
made by a wanton maid unthinking. Half-way over the hill he slipped on the
edge of a drift, and a sore wound in the side he got against a splinter of
the blue stone of the Quey's Rock; but he pushed on, with the blood oozing
through his cut vest. Yet, in spite of himself, he slept beyond the Bog of
the Fairy-Maid. <i>Mo-thruaigh! mo-thruaigh!</i>
</p>
<p>
The Fairy-Maid came and covered him up close and warm with a white blanket
that needs no posting, and sang the soft tune a man hears but once, and
kissed him on the beard as he slept in the drift&mdash;and his name had
been Ellar Ban.
</p>
<p>
Round by the king's good highroad came Solomon the carrier with his cart,
and many a time he thought of turning between Carnus and Kilmune. But he
was of the stuff of Clan Coll, and his mare was Proud Maisie. He had a
boll of meal from Portinsherrich, from the son of a widow woman who was
hungry in Inneraora and waiting for that same.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No Ellar here yet!&rdquo; he said at Kilmune when he asked, and they told him.
&ldquo;Then there's a story to tell, for if he's not here, he's not at Karnes,
and his grave's on the grey mountain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Later came Luath, the collie of Ellar, slinking through the snow wet and
weary, and without wind enough for barking. 'Twas as good as the man's
ghost.
</p>
<p>
The shepherds came in from the fanks, and over from the curling at
Carlonan, to go on a search.
</p>
<p>
Long Duncan of Drimfem, the slim swarthy champion, was there before them.
He was a pretty man&mdash;the like never tied a shoe in Glenaora&mdash;and
he was the real one who had Mairi's eye, which the dead fellow thought had
the laugh only for him. But, lord! a young man with a good name with the
shinty and the <i>clachneart</i> has other things to think of than the
whims of women, and Donacha never noticed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We'll go up and see about it&mdash;about him at once, Main,&rdquo; he said,
sick-sorry for the girl. All the rest stood round pitying, because her
kists were said to be full of her own spinning for the day that was not to
be.
</p>
<p>
Mairi took him to the other side of the peat-stack, and spoke with a red
face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it any use your going till the snow's off the hill, Drimfem?&rdquo; she
said, biting at the corner of her brattie, and not looking the man in the
face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Dhia gleiih sinn!</i> it's who knows when the white'll be off the
snouts of these hills, and we can't wait till&mdash;&mdash; I thought it
would ease your mind.&rdquo; And Donacha looked at the maid stupid enough. For a
woman with her heart on the hill, cold, she was mighty queer on it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes; but it's dangerous for you to go up, and the showers so heavy
yet. It's not twenty finger-lengths you can see in front of you, and you
might go into the bog.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is't the bog I would be thinking of, Main? It's little fear there is of
that, for here is the man that has been on Salachary when the mist was
like smoke, as well as when the spittle froze in my mouth. Oh, I'm not the
one to talk; but where's the other like me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mairi choked. &ldquo;But, Dona&mdash;&mdash; but, Drimfem, it's dead Ellar must
be; and&mdash;and&mdash;you have a widow mother to mind.&rdquo; Donacha looked
blank at the maid. She had the sweet face, yon curve of the lip, and the
soft turn of the neck of all Arthur's children, ripe of the cheek, with
tossed hair like a fairy of the lake, and the quirk of the eye that never
left a plain man at ease if he was under the threescore. There were knives
out in the glen for many a worse one.
</p>
<p>
It was the lee of the peat-stack they stood in, and the falling flakes
left for a while without a shroud a drop of crimson at the girl's feet.
She was gripping tight at her left wrist under the cover of her apron till
the nails cut the flesh. There was the stress of a dumb bard's sorrow in
her face; her heart was in her eyes, if there had been a woman to see it;
but Drimfern missed it, for he had no mind of the dance at the last Old
New Year, or the ploy at the sheep-dipping, or the nuts they cracked on
the hot peats at Hallowe'en.
</p>
<p>
The girl saw he was bound to go. He was as restless as if the snow was a
swarm of <i>seangans</i>. She had not two drops of blood in her lips, but
she tried to laugh as she took something out from a pocket and half held
it out to him. He did not understand at first, for if he was smart on the
<i>caman</i> ball, 'twas slow in the ways of women he was.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's daft I am. I don't know what it is, Donacha, but I had a dream that
wasn't canny last night, and I'm afraid, I'm afraid,&rdquo; said the poor girl.
&ldquo;I was going to give you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Drimfern could not get the meaning of the laugh, strained as it was. He
thought the maid's reason was wandering.
</p>
<p>
She had, whatever it was&mdash;a square piece of cloth of a woman's sewing&mdash;into
the man's hand before he knew what she would be after; and when his
fingers closed on it, she would have given a king's gold to get it back.
But the Tullich lads, and the Paymaster's shepherd from Lecknamban, with
Dol' Splendid and Francie Ro, in their plaids, and with their crooks, came
round the gable-end. Luath, who knew Glenaora as well as he knew Creag
Cranda, was with them, and away they went for the hill. All that Donacha
the blind one said, as he put the sewing in his pocket to look at again,
was, &ldquo;Blessing with thee!&rdquo; for all the world like a man for the fair.
</p>
<p>
Still the nor' wind, and the snow, and the dark frost said &ldquo;<i>Suas e!</i>&rdquo;
 running down the glen like the strong dogs on the peching deer; and the
men were not a hundred yards away from the potato-pit when they were
ghosts that went out altogether, without a sound, like Drimendorran's Grey
Dame in the Red Forester's story.
</p>
<p>
A white face on a plump neck stood the sting of the storm dourly, though
the goodwife said it would kill her out there, and the father cried
&ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; on her sorrow, and her a maiden. &ldquo;Where's the decency of you?&rdquo;
 says he, fierce-like; &ldquo;if it was a widow you were this day you couldn't
show your heart more.&rdquo; And into the house he went and supped two cogies of
brose, and swore at the <i>sgalag</i> for noticing that his cheeks were
wet.
</p>
<p>
When the searchers would be high on the hill Shudderman came on the maid.
He was a wizened, daft old one, always in a tinker Fencible's tartan trews
and scarlet doublet. He would pucker his bare brown face like a foreign
Italian, and whistle continually. The whistle was on his face when he came
on the girl standing behind the byre, looking up with a corpse's whiteness
where the Beannan should be.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Te-he! Lord! but we're cunning,&rdquo; said the soldier. &ldquo;It's a pity about
Ellar, is it not, white darling?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mairi saw nothing, but swallowed a sob. Was this thing to know her secret,
when the wise old women of the glen never guessed it? There was something
that troubled her in his look.
</p>
<p>
The wee creature put his shoulder against the peats, and shoved each hand
up the other sleeve of his doublet, while he whistled soft, and cunningly
looked at the maid. The cords of her neck were working, and her breast
heaved sore, but she kept her teeth tight together.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, it's an awful thing, and him so fond, too,&rdquo; he went on; and his
face was nothing but a handful of wrinkles and peat-smoke. It was a bigger
ploy for the fool than a good dinner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&mdash;who&mdash;who are you talking about, you poor <i>amadan?</i>&rdquo;
 cried Mairi, desperately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Och, it's yourself that'll know. They're saying over at Tullich and upbye
at Miss Jean's, Accurach, that it's a bonny pair you would make, you and
Ellar. Yonnat Yalla says he was the first Lochow man ever she saw that
would go a mile out of his way for a lass, and I saw him once come the
roundabout road by Cladich because it was too easy to meet you coming the
short cut over the hill. Oh! there's no doubt he was fond, fond, and-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Amadan!</i>&rdquo; cried the maid, with no canny light in her eyes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hoots! You're not angry with me, darling. I ken, I ken. Of course
Drimfern's the swanky lad too, but it's not very safe this night on yon
same hill. There's the Bog of the Fairy-Maid that never was frozen yet,
and there's the Quey's Rock, and&mdash;te-he! I wouldn't give much for
some of them not coming back any more than poor Ellar. It's namely that
Drimfem got the bad eye from the Glenurchy woman come Martinmas next
because of his taking up with her cousin-german's girl, Morag Callum.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yon <i>spàgachd</i> doll, indeed!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;God, I do not know about that! but they're telling me he had her up at
all the reels at Baldy Geepie's wedding, whatever, and it's a Maclean
tartan frock she got for the same&mdash;I saw it with my own eyes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lies, lies, lies,&rdquo; said the girl to herself her lips dry, her hands and
feet restless to do some crazy thing to kill the pain in her heart.
</p>
<p>
She was a little helpless bird in the hands of the silly one.
</p>
<p>
He was bursting himself inside with laughing, that couldn't be seen for
the snow and the cracks on his face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But it's not marriages nor tartan you'll be thinking on, Mairi, with your
own lad up there stiff. Let Morag have Drimfem&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You and your Morag! Shudderman, if it was not the crazy one you were, you
would see that a man like Donacha Drimfern would have no dealings with the
breed of MacCallum, tinker children of the sixty fools.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Fools here or fools there, look at them in the castle at Duntroon! And
Drimfern is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Drimfern again! Who's thinking of Drimfern, the mother's big pet, the
soft, soft creature, the poor thing that's daft about the shinty and the
games&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash; Go inbye, haverer, and&mdash;&mdash;oh,
my heart, my heart!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Cripple Callum,&rdquo; whistled the daft wee one; and faith it was the great
sport he was having! The flame sparkled in the lass's eyes; she stamped
furiously in the snow. She could have gone into the house, but the
Shudderman would follow, and the devil was in him, and she might just as
well tell her story at the cross-roads as risk. So she stayed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come in this minute, O foolish one!&rdquo; her mother came to the door and
craved; but no.
</p>
<p>
The wee <i>bodach</i> took a wee pipe from his big poke and started at the
smoking. When his match went out the dark was almost flat on the glen, and
a night-hag complained with a wean's cry in the planting beyond the burn.
At each draw of the pipe the eyes of the soldier glinted like a ferret's,
and like any ferret's they were watching. He put in a word between-while
that stabbed the poor thing's heart, about the shame of love in maids
uncourted, and the cruelty of maids that cast love-looks for mischief.
There were some old havers about himself here and there among the words:
of a woman who changed her mind and went to another man's bed and board;
of sport up the glen, and burials beyond; and Ellar Ban's widow mother,
and the carry-on of Drimfem and the Glenurchy woman's cousin-german's
girl. And it was all ravelled, like the old story Loch Finne comes up on
the shore to tell when the moon's on Sithean Sluaidhe.
</p>
<p>
The girl was sobbing sore. &ldquo;Man!&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;give me the peace of
a night till we know what is.&rdquo; The <i>amadan</i> laughed at her, and went
shauchling down to the cotter's, and Mairi went in out of the darkness.
</p>
<p>
The hours passed and passed, and the same leash of strong dogs were
scouring like fury down Glenaora, and the moon looked a little through a
hole, and was sickly at the sight, and went by in a hurry. A collie's bark
in the night came to the house where the people waited round the peats,
and &ldquo;Oh, my heart!&rdquo; said poor Mairi.
</p>
<p>
The father took the tin lantern with the holes in it, and they all went
out to the house-end. The lantern-light stuck long needles in the night as
it swung on the goodman's finger, and the byre and the shed and the
peat-stack danced into the world and out of it, and the clouds were only
an arm's-length overhead.
</p>
<p>
The men were coming down the brae in the smother of snow, carrying
something in a plaid. The dog was done with its barking, and there was no
more sound from the coming ones than if they were ghosts. Like enough to
ghosts they looked. No one said a word till the goodman spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have him there?&rdquo; he said.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, <i>beatmachi leis!</i> all that there is of him,&rdquo; said the
Paymaster's man; and they took it but an' ben, where Mairi's mother had
the white dambrod cloth she had meant for herself, when her own time came,
on the table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's poor Ellar, indeed,&rdquo; said the goodman, noticing the fair beard.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where's Donacha? where's Drimfern?&rdquo; cried Mairi, who had pulled herself
together and come in from the byre-end, where she had waited to see if
there was none of the watchers behind.
</p>
<p>
The Paymaster's man was leaning against the press-door, with a face like
the clay; Dol' Splendid was putting a story in the <i>sgalag's</i> ear;
the Tullich men were very busy on it taking the snow off their boots.
Outside the wind had the sorry song of the curlew.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Me-the-day! it's the story of this there is to tell,&rdquo; at last said
Francie Ro, with a shake of the head. &ldquo;Poor Drimfern&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Drimfem&mdash;ay, where's Drimfem in all the world?&rdquo; said the goodman,
with a start. He was standing before his girl to keep her from seeing the
thing on the table till the wife had the boots covered. It was the face of
a <i>cailleach</i> of threescore Mairi had.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's God knows! We were taking Ellar there down, turn about resting. It
was a cruel business, for the drifts. There's blood on his side where he
fell somewhere, and Drimfern had to put a clout on it to keep the blood
off his plaid. That's Drimfern's plaid. When Donacha's second turn was
over up at the bog, we couldn't get a bit of him. He's as lost as the deer
the Duke shot, and we looked and whistled for hours.&rdquo; The maid gave a wee
turn to the door, shivered, and fell like a clod at her mother's feet.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look at yon, now! Am not I the poor father altogether?&rdquo; said the old man
with a soft lip to his friends. &ldquo;Who would think, and her so healthy, and
not married to Ellar, that she would be so much put about? You'll excuse
it in her, lads, I know, for she's not twenty till the dipping-time, and
the mother maybe spoiled her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Och, well,&rdquo; said the Splendid one, twisting his bonnet uneasy in his
hands, &ldquo;I've seen them daft enough over a living lad, and it's no great
wonder when this one's dead.&rdquo; They took the maid beyond to the big room by
the kitchen, and a good mother's morning for Drimfern was set by the men.
They had a glass before going home, and when they were gone the <i>bochdans</i>
came in the deep hollow of the night and rattled the windows and shook the
door-sneck; but what cared yon long white thing on the goodwife's dambrod
tablecloth?
</p>
<p>
At the mouth of day there was one woman with a gnawing breast looking
about the glen-foot among the snow for the Shudder-man soldier. She found
him snedding the shaft of a shinny-stick at the Stronmagachan Gate, and
whistling as if it was six weeks south of Whitsunday and the woods piping
in the heat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I ken all about it, my white little lamb,&rdquo; he said with a soft speech.
&ldquo;All about them finding Ellar, and losing a better man, redding put her to
rights. A search in the maybe, but any way one that some will miss more.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;God's heavy, heavy on a woman!&rdquo; said the poor child. &ldquo;I gave Donacha a
sampler with something sewn on it yesterday, and the men, when they go up
the hill to look for him to-day, will get it on him&mdash;and&mdash;it
would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, ay! I ken, my dear. We'll put that right, or I'm no soldier.&rdquo; And
the little man cocked his bonnet on his head like a piper. Then he was
sorry for the pride of it, and he pulled it down on his face, and whistled
to stop his nose from jagging.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My heart! my bruised heart! they're saying sorry things of Ellar, and
Donacha dead. The cotter's wife was talking this morning, and it'll send
me daft!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Blind, blind,&rdquo; quo' the soldier; &ldquo;but you'll not be shamed, if the <i>amadan</i>
can help it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But what can you do, my poor Shudderman? And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;there's
no one between Carnus and Croit-bhile I can speak to of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Go home, white love, and I'll make it right,&rdquo; said the daft one, and
faith he looked like meaning it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; thought the girl. Shudderman was chief enough with the
Glenurchy woman, and the Glenurchy woman sometimes gave her spells to her
friends. So Mairi went home half comforted.
</p>
<p>
A cogie of brose and a bit braxy in his belly, and a farl of cake in his
poke, and out stepped the Shudderman with never a word to any one about
the end of his journey. Dol' Splendid had told him the story of the night
before, and whereabout Drimfern was lost, close beyond the Beannan. He
would find the body and the sampler, he promised himself as he plunged up
the brae at Taravh-dubh. The dogs were nearly as furious as the night
before, and the day's eye was blear. Hours passed, and the flats of
Kilmune were far below.
</p>
<p>
There was nothing in all the world but whiteness, and a silly old <i>bodach</i>
with a red coat trailing across it. Shudderman Soldier sank his head
between his shoulders as he pushed himself up with his hazel crook, his
tartan trews in rags about his ankles, his doublet letting in the teeth of
the wind here and there, and at the best grudging sore its too tight
shelter for his shrunk body. He had not the wind to whistle, but he gasped
bits of &ldquo;Faill-il-o,&rdquo; and between he swore terribly at the white hares
that jerked across in front of him with the ill-luck of a lifetime on
their backs.
</p>
<p>
If it was the earth that was white, the sky was not far behind it; if they
were paper, it would take schooling to write on them straight, for there
wasn't a line between them. The long sweep of Balantyre itself was lost,
and the Beannan stone was buried. The creature's brogues were clods of
snow, ugly, big, without a shape: his feet were lumps of ice; his knees
shook under his frail skinful of bones; but, by the black stones, 'twas
the man's heart he had!
</p>
<p>
When the snow made a paste on his win'ard cheek, he had it off with a jerk
of the head, and one of the jerks put off his bonnet. Its frozen ribbons
had been whipping his eyes, and he left it where it fell, with never a
glance over his shoulder. His hair clogged with flakes that kept the frost
even after they fell. It was a peching effort for the foot of the Beannan
brae.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor lamb, poor Mairi, calf of my heart!&rdquo; gasped the soldier to himself.
He was staggering half blind through the smother of snow, now and then
with a leg failing below him, and plunging him right or left. Once his
knees shut like a gardener's gully, and he made a crazy heap in the drift.
His tired wrists could hardly bring him up, and the corpse of the world
swung in his eyes when he was on his feet again and trying to steady
himself.
</p>
<p>
There's a green knoll beside the Bog of the Fairy-Maid, where the wee
folks dance reels when the moon's on it, and there the old fellow
struggled to. He thought if he was up there he would see some sign of what
he wanted. Up he pushed, with the hazel <i>cromag</i> bending behind him,
and his brogues slipping on the round snow-soles. Up he went, with the
pluck of a whole man, let alone a poor silly object; up he went till he
got his foot on the top, and then his heart failed, for he saw nothing of
what he sought.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll look again when I'm out of this foolish sleep,&mdash;I'll see better
when I waken,&rdquo; said the poor <i>amadan;</i> and behold the dogs were on
him! and he was a man who was.
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<br /><br />
</p>
<p>
For all that, the story tells, Drimfern was no ghost. When he was lost he
found Kames, where the Callum girl was that came to his fire-end later and
suckled his clan. And Ellar's mother, dressing her son's corpse in the
house at Kilmune, found on his wound a sampler that went with him to his
long home in green Inishail. Its letters, sewn in the folly of a woman,
told her story:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than
wine.&rdquo;
 </p>

WAR.
</h2>
<h3>
I.
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was the pause of the morning, when time stands, and night and day
breathe hard ere they get to grips. A cock with a foggy throat started at
the crowing, down at Slochd-a-Chubair. Over from Stron a shrewd thin wind
came to make stir among the trees in the Duke's big garden, and the crows
rasped their beaks on the beech-branches, for they knew that here was the
day's forerunner. Still and on the town slept, stretched full out, dour
set on the business. Its quirky lanes and closes were as black as the pit.
There was only one light in all the place, and a big town and a bonny it
is, house and house with high outside stairs and glass windows, so that
the wonder is the King himself does not take thought to stay in it, even
if it were only for the comfort of it and the company of the MacCailein
Mor. Only one light, and that was splashing, yellow, and mixed with a
thick peat-reek, out of Jean Rob's open door, facing the bay, on the left,
on the Lowlands road. Now and then Jean would come to the door and stand,
a blob of darkness in the yellow light, to see if the day was afoot on Ben
Ime, or to throw a look at the front of the town for signs of folk
stirring.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a peep, not a peep! Sleep! sleep! Few of them part with a man to-day
with so sore a heart as Jean Rob.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then back to her Culross girdle, for she was at the baking of bannocks to
go in her husband's <i>dorlach</i> for the wars.
</p>
<p>
She had not shut an eye all night. Rob snored at her side slow and heavy
while she lay on her back on a bed of white hay, staring up at the black
larch joists glinting with the red scad of the peats. She was a Crarae
woman, and that same people were given to be throng with the head, and she
kept thinking, thinking even on. At last she could bide it no longer, so
she up with a leap on the floor to face a new day and all the luck of it.
</p>
<p>
About the luck being good or ill there might be little doubt. It was the
year after they started at the building of the Castle, a laggard spring at
the hind-end of a cruel winter, with not a fin in all the seas for the
poor fishermen, and black mutton at six Saxon shillings the side. And what
the wars were about Jean Rob or her like little knew or cared. Very
little, like enough, as is the way with wars, but any way wars there were:
the Duke and his House would have it that their people must up and on with
belt and target, and away on the weary road like their fathers before
them. Some said it was the old game with the Inverlochy dogs (rive them
and seize them!); others, that some bastard was at variance with the Duke
about the Papist Stewarts&mdash;a silly lad called Tearlach with a pack of
wild Irishers and daddy Macleans and Macdonalds and Camerons from the
Isles and the North at his back.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bundle and Go&rdquo; it was any way in Campbell country from Cruachan to Cowal,
from Cantyre to the march of Keppochan, and that's the fine rolling land
of sappy grasses and thick woods. In the heart and midst of it Duke Archie
played dirl on the boss of his shield on a cold March day, and before
night swords were at the sharping from shore to shore. That's war for ye&mdash;
</p>
<p>
quicker than flame, surer than word of mouth, and poor's the man who says
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; to his chief.
</p>
<p>
Rob Donn, for all that, was vassal to no man; for he was come of the
swordsmiths of the glen, and they had paper to show that their rigs were
held for no service other than beating out good fighting steel on the
anvil. Poor, as he was, he could wear one feather in his bonnet if his
fancy was on feathers, and no one bragged more of his forefolk. But
Elrigmor&mdash;a thin old man with little stomach for quarrels&mdash;offered
twenty pounds English for a man to take his place with the Campbells; and
Rob took the money and the loan of Elrigmor's sword, half for the sake of
the money and half for the sake of a bit play with Sir Claymore.
</p>
<p>
Said he to his wife, jingling the Geordies in his hand on the day he got
them, &ldquo;Here's the price of a hero; and troth it's little enough for a good
armsmith's blood!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don't say it, Rob,&rdquo; said Jean.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Och! I am but laughing at thee, good-wife. Brave dogs would they be that
would face the tusks of the Diarmaid boars. Like the wind on the chaff&mdash;troosh!&mdash;we'll
scatter them! In a week I'll be home.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In a week?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure, Jean. I'll buy with the money a stot or two on the road to
bring back with me, for there's little lifting in the Duke's corps, more's
the pity! My grandfather seldom came back from the wars without a few head
of cattle before him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
So the money went in Rob Donn's sporran, and Jean would have bit her
tongue out before she would crave for part o't from a man going among
strangers and swords.
</p>
<p>
The bairn had but one word for her father from then till he started, and
that was &ldquo;Cockade.&rdquo; What it was the little one never knew, but that it was
something braw and costly, a plaything for a father to go far off for.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Two or three of them, my white love!&rdquo; would Rob Donn say, fond and
hearty. &ldquo;They'll be as thick as nuts on the ground when we're done of the
gentry that wear them on their bonnets.&rdquo; And he had a soft wet eye for the
child, a weakling, white and thin, never quite the better of the snell
winds of winter. If cockades, indeed, were to be had for the fighting of a
fortnight without sleep, Rob Donn would have them for her.
</p>
<p>
So now was the morning to put on fighting gear and go on the foray for
white cockades.
</p>
<p>
By-and-by a cruisie-light crept out at the gables of the town, and the
darkness filled with the smell of new peat burning. Aora, spluttering past
Jean Rob's door with a gulp into the Cooper's Pool, made, within the
house, the only sound of the morning.
</p>
<p>
Jean scraped the meal off her hands and went again to the door to look
about and listen.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay! up at last,&rdquo; she said to herself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's the Major's light, and Kate Mhor up for the making of his
breakfast, and a lowe in the weaver's shed. The Provost's is dark&mdash;poor
man!&mdash;it's little his lady is caring!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She was going to turn about and in, when the squeal of a bagpipe came from
the town-head, and the player started to put his drones in order. &ldquo;Ochan!
ochan!&rdquo; said poor Jean, for here, indeed, was the end of her hopes; there
was no putting back from the Duke's errand. She listened a little to the
tuning as if it was the finest of <i>piobaireachds</i>, and it brought a
curious notion to her mind of the first reel she danced with her man to
the squeezing of that same sheepskin. Then the reeds roared into the air
of &ldquo;Baile Inneraora.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Och a Dhé! siod e nis! Eirich, eirich, Rob!&rdquo;</i> she cried in to the
man among the blankets, but there was no need for the summons. The
gathering rang far ben in the chambers of sleep, and Rob was stark awake,
with a grasp at his hip for the claymore.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Troth! I thought it was the camp! and them on us,&rdquo; he laughed foolishly
in his beard.
</p>
<p>
Up and down the street went Dol' Dubh, the Duke's second piper, the same
who learned the art of music right well from the Macruimens of Boreraig,
and he had as sweet a finger on the chanter as Padruig himself, with the
nerve to go round the world. Fine, fine it was for him, be sure, to be the
summoner to battle! Lights jumped to the little lozens of the windows and
made streaks on the cracks of the doors, and the Major's man came from his
loft ganting with a mouth like the glee'd gun, a lantern swinging on a
finger, making for the stable to saddle his master's horse. A garret
window went up with a bang, and Peter MacIntyre, wright, pat out a towsy
head and snuffed the air. It was low tide in the two bays, and the town
was smelling less of peat-reek than of sea-wrack and saltness. One star
hung in the north over Dunchuach.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They have the good day for starting the jaunt, whatever,&rdquo; said the
wright. &ldquo;If I was a stone or two lighter, and had one to look after the
shop, it's off on this ploy I would be too.&rdquo; He took in his head, the top
nodding briskly on his Kilmarnock bonnet, and wakened the wife to help him
on with his clothes.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Aora, Aora, Baile Inneraora,
I got a bidding to Baile Inneraora;
I got the bidding, but little they gave me,
Aora, Aora, Baile Chailein Mhoir!&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
Dol' Dubh was up at the Cross, swelled out like a net-bow, blasting
furiously, his heart athump with the piper's zest. Doors drummed, windows
screeched in their cases, women's voices went from land to land, and the
laugh and cry of bairns new roused from the hot toss of dreams. Far up the
highroad a horse's hoofs were dunting hollow and hearty on the stones, and
by-and-by through the Arches trotted the Cornal, his tall body straight
and black against the dun of the gables. He had a voice like a rutting
deer. &ldquo;Master Piper,&rdquo; he roared to Dol' Dubh, tugging his beast back on
its haunches, &ldquo;stop that braggart air and give us 'Bundle and Go,' and God
help the Campbell that's not on the Cadger's Quay before the sun's over
Stron Point!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where is the air like it?&rdquo; said Dol' to himself, slacking a reed with a
thumb-nail. &ldquo;Well they ken it where little they love it with its
vaunting!&rdquo; But he up with his drones on his shoulder and into the tune
that had the Cornal's fancy. Beside him the Cornal stood at his horse's
stirrup in the grey-brown of the morning, his head still light with the
bottle of claret wine his lady in Lecknamban had put before him ere he had
boot over saddle.
</p>
<p>
Then the town stirred to its affairs. The Major's horse went clattering
over the cobblestones to his door-end, the arm-room door opened, and old
Nanny Bheag, who kept the key, was lifted off her feet and in, on the rush
of young lads making for the new guns Lome Clerk had up from the Low
Country. On the belts of the older men, loth to leave the fire-end,
mothers and wives were hanging bags with thick farls of cake, and cheese,
and the old Aora salve for swordcuts.
</p>
<p>
If they had their way of it, these <i>caille-achan</i>, the fighting gear
would be all kebbucks of cheese and dry hose, and no powder and ball. The
men blustered, high-breasted, with big words in their beards, and no name
too dirty for the crew they were off to scatter&mdash;praising themselves
and making the fine prophecies, as their folks did before them with better
rights when the town was more in the way of going to wars. Or they roundly
scolded the weans for making noise, though their eyes were learning every
twist of the copper hair and every trick of the last moment, to think on
when long and dreary would be the road before them.
</p>
<p>
There was a break in Dol' Dubh's music, and high over the big town rang
the Cornal's voice, starting the bairns in their sleep and setting them up
and screaming.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Laggards! laggards! O lazy ones! Out! out! Campbells before were never so
swear't to be marching. It is time to be steeping the withies!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Hard back went the stout doors on the walls, and out ran the folk. The
brogues skliffed and hammered; men with muskets, swords, dirks, and targes
ran down the street, and women and children behind them. A tumult filled
the town from side to side and end to end, and the lanes and closes were
streaming with the light from gaping doors.
</p>
<p>
Old and young, the boy and the snooded girl, women with bairn at breast,
<i>bodach</i> and <i>cailleach</i>, took to the Cross muster, leaving the
houses open to the wind and to the world. The cats thrummed by the fires,
and the smell of the sea-wrack came in beside them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have you here at last,&rdquo; said the Cornal, dour and dark, throwing his
keen eyes along the row of men. &ldquo;Little credit are ye to my clan and
chief, and here's to the Lowlands low, and would to God I was there now
among the true soldados with stomachs for slaughter and the right skill of
fence and musketoon! A short tulzie, and a tow at the thrapple of bastard
Chevalier would there be in that case. Here's but a wheen herds, weavers,
and gillies holding Brown Betty like a kail-runt!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He was one of the Craignish Campbells, the Cornal&mdash;Dugald, brother of
Lachan who got death at a place called Fontenoy in the summer before&mdash;very
sib to the Duke, and it behoved the town-men to say nothing. But they
cursed his eyes to each other on the corners of their mouths, and if he
knew it he had sense enough to say nothing.
</p>
<p>
The women and bairns and the old folks stood in a great crowd behind the
Cornal's horse. The Major's mare with him in the sell was dancing an
uncanny spring near the Arches, full of freshness and fine feeding as a
battle-horse should be, but overly much that way for a man sixteen
finger-lengths round the belly and full of fish and ale. From Glen Beag
came the slow morning, gusty and stinging; Stob-an-Eas stood black against
the grey of it; the tide stretched from shore to shore unfriendly and
forlorn.
</p>
<p>
Jean Rob, with the bairn at her brattie-string, was with the other women
seeing her man away, stupid with two sorrows&mdash;one because he was
going, and the other because he had twenty pounds in his sporran that he
might well be doing without; for he was leaving the woman without a groat,
and only a boll of meal in the girnel and a wee firkin of salted fish.
</p>
<p>
The steady breeze came yet from Stron, and sat snug in the sails of the
six boats that carried the Duke's men over to Cowal. Brog-and-Turk's skiff
put out first, himself at the helm in his tarry jacket; the others, deep
down, followed close on her heels. One by one they fell off from the quay.
The men waved their bonnets and cried cheerily and vaunting, as was aye
the good grace of Clan Diarmaid at the first and the last of forays.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Blessings with ye!&rdquo; cried the folk left behind, wet-eyed; and even the
Provost's wife took a grief at her inside to see her man with a shaking
lip look round the sail of the hin'most boat. Cheering and weeping,
singing and <i>ochain!</i> there they were on the quay and on the sea, our
own folk, our dear folk; and who were ever like them when it came to the
bit, and stout hearts or kind hearts were wanted?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stand back, kindred!&rdquo; cried the Cornal, putting spurs to his horse, and
he pranced up the town-head, a pretty man, to join the Major and gallop
round the loch-head to join the corps at Cairn-dubh.
</p>
<p>
Dol' Dubh stopped his playing at the bow of Brog-an-Turk's skiff when she
gulped the first quaich of brine, and the men in all the boats started to
sing the old boat-song of &ldquo;Aora Mo Chridhe tha mi seoladh&rdquo;&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Aora, my heart, I am sailing, sailing,
Far to the South on the slope of the sea;
Aora <i>mo chridhe</i>, it is cold is the far land,
Bitter the stranger with wands on his doorway.
Aora Mochree!&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
It came back on the wind with a sorrow to break hearts, sinking and
swelling as the wind took the fancy, and the long-necked herons stood on
the fringe of the tide with their heads high to listen. The sails got
scattered and shrunk, and the tune got thin and low, and lost at last in
the swish of the waves on the shore, and the ears of those who listened
heard the curlew piping cursedly loud over the Cooper's Pool. A grey cold
day with rain on the tail of it. High Creag Dubh with its firs and alders
and rowans stark and careless over the hollow town. Broad day and
brightness, and the cruisies and candles burning the ghosts of flame in
the empty houses, with doors wide to the empty street and the lanes and
closes!
</p>
<h3>
II.

<p>
The wanderer has ever the best of it, and wae wae are the hearts behind I
Is it for war or sport, or for the red gold, that a man turns heel on his
home and takes the world for his pillow? In his pack is the salve for care
as well as for sword-cuts, for ever and always are new things happening.
The road crooks through the curious glens; the beasts trot among the grass
and fern and into the woods; the girls (the dear ones, the red-lipped
ones!) come from the milking of the white-shouldered cattle and look with
soft black eyes as he passes, and there is a new tale at the corner of
every change-house fire. All that may befall a packman; but better's the
lot of the fighter with steel at his haunch, fire at his heart, and every
halt a day closer to them he would be seeking.
</p>
<p>
But the folks behind in the old place! <i>Mo thruaigh! mo thruaigh!</i>
Daybreak, and hot sun, and the creeping in of the night, when the door
must be snecked on the rover; the same place, and still with a want in it,
and only guessing at where and how is the loved one out on strange ways on
the broad world.
</p>
<p>
Far up the long Highlands the Campbells were on their way. Loch Sloy and
Glen Falloch, Rannoch's bleakness and Ben Alder's steepness, and each
morning its own wet grass and misty brae, and each night its dreams on the
springy heather.
</p>
<p>
A woman was weeping on Achadunan because that her man was gone and her
chimney stone was cold, and Rob Donn's sporran was emptied at her feet,
though he knew not so much as the name of her. But he took a thought and
said, &ldquo;I'll keep the half, for long's the way before us, and ill is
travelling among strangers without a round-piece in the purse.&rdquo; That was
but a day's march from Jean Rob, and she was making a supper of crowdie
that was the first meal of the day.
</p>
<p>
On Spey-side was the camp of the Argylls, and card-play round the fires,
with the muskets shining, and the pipes playing sweeter for slumber than
for rouse.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will put my watch on this turn,&rdquo; said a black Lowlander in the heat of
the game.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Rob Donn's watch is the sun on Toman-uardar,&rdquo; said our hero, &ldquo;but here
are ten yellow Geordies,&rdquo; and out went his fortune among the roots of the
gall.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Troosh! beannachd leat!</i>&rdquo; and the coin was a jingle in the other
one's pouch.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have plenty more where it came from, and cattle enough forbye,&rdquo; said
our braggart, and he turned on his elbow whistling &ldquo;Crodh Chailein.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But let them follow the drum who will, for us the story's beside the
hearth. It is not a clatter of steel and the tulzies of Chevaliers, but
the death of an only bairn.
</p>
<p>
In her house on the Lowlands road Jean Rob starved with the true Highland
pride, that sets a face content against the world at kirk or market.
Between her and a craving stomach lay but shell-fish and herbs, for she
had not a plack to spend, and the little one got all the milk that came
from Mally, the dappled one, drying up for calving. Break of day would see
the woman, white, thin, keen-eyed, out on the ebb before the fishing-boats
were in, splashing in the pools in the sand for partans and clabbie-doos,
or with two ready fingers piercing the sand to pull the long spout-fish
from his hiding. Or she would put little stakes in the sand, and between
them a taut line with baited hooks to coax the fish at high tide. But ill
was her luck, indeed, for few were the fish that came to the lure to be
lifted again at ebb.
</p>
<p>
Above Kilmalieu on the sea side of Dunchu-ach, in the tangle and dark of
the trees, among the soft splashing soil, the wild leeks gave a scent to
the air. These would Jean gather, and the nettle too, and turn them to
thin broth; but that same was no fare for a Crarae stomach.
</p>
<p>
At night when the wee one slept, the mother would have her plaid on her
head, and through the town, barefoot, in the darkness, passing the folk at
the close-mouths quickly for fear they would speak to her, and her heart
would crave for share of the noble supper that made steam from the door of
her cousin the rich merchant.
</p>
<p>
Like a ghost sometimes, wandering about the Cadger's Quay or the
gutting-stools, where she would be looking for a dropped giley or a bake
from the nets, she would come on a young woman.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Dhe!</i> Jean Rob! is it thyself that is here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just Jean, my darling, for a little turn, because of the stir in the
town, and the smell of the barking nets. Well I like the smell of the
bark, and the wind takes little of it up the Lowlands road.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thou art not coming out much since the men went to the North. Art well at
the house&mdash;the little one, now, bless her?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Splendid, splendid, <i>m' eudail</i>. Faith, it is too fat we will be
getting on the fortune Rob got from Elrigmor.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, yes, Jean, it was the great luck! When a poor person comes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hut tut! Poor nor rich, my people had their own place on Lochowside, and
little did my Rob need MacNicol's dirty money; but he was aye fond of a
'horo-yally,' and that's the way of his being among them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, if that's the way, our own people were good enough on a time;
but a pedigree, thou wilt allow, is a poor plaster for a pain in the
stomach. For me, I would have a good shaking of herring and money in the
town. It was but black brochan for our one meal to-day, and my mother
poorly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear! <i>och</i>, my dear! and I to brag of plenty! Little enough, in
truth, is on my own board; but I have a boiling of meal if you come for it
in the morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Kindly, kindly, thou good dame. It would be but a loan.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, indeed, one will be running out of the wherewithal now and again,
and 'twas aye 'Mine is yours and yours is mine' in Gaeldom. But I must be
stepping.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And while Jean Rob starved, there was never a word from the best and
bravest off at the wars, or how they fared, only now and then a half tale
from a travelling caird or a Low-Country carrier about gatherings and
skirling pipes and hard knocks. His Grace himself kept a horse or two and
a good rider on the other side of the Rest, to gallop hot-hoof into the
Castle with the first news of how his clan won; but weary was the waiting.
</p>
<p>
The town took to its old appearance, the aged men clack-clacking with the
shuttle, the boys scattering seed over the rig-and-fur of the ploughed
fields, the women minding their houses. And that, too, is war for ye! The
dirk is out, the brogues trail over the hills and through the glens, the
clans meet and clash, the full heart belches blood, the grass soaks, the
world and the chance of it is put on the luck of a swinging stroke at yon
one's neck. War! war! red and lusty&mdash;the jar of it fills the land!
But oh, <i>mo chridhe!</i> home in Glen Shie are women and bairns living
their own day's life, and the crack will be blithe in the sheilings to
come, for all your quarrels. Where is Hector, and where is
Gilean-of-the-Axe, and where is Diarmaid of the boar's snout? They are all
gone but for an old song at the sheiling-fire, and life, love, and the
Fell Sergeant still come and go in the place the warriors made such stir
in! A stranger would think there was little amiss in the Duke's town. The
women sang their long songs of love and yore as they span about the wheel
and carded the wool; the bairns guddled in Jumping John's burn, and tore
their kilts among the whins, and came home with the crows, redfaced and
hungry-warned. At the ale-house there was traffic by day, and heavy
drovers and gaugers stamped their feet to the choruses at night. The day
lengthened, and comforting winds came from the two bonny black glens; the
bracken put on new growths, like the crook of St Molach that's up-by in
the Castle; Easachosain reeled to the piping of birds.
</p>
<p>
There might be an eye many times a-day on the Stron Point to see if a
horseman was rounding it, and the cruisies were kept burning a little
longer at night in case the news would come in the darkness like the Athol
thieves. But patience was ever the gift of the Gael, and few lost heart.
</p>
<p>
And at last the news came of Culloden Moor.
</p>
<p>
It was on a Sunday&mdash;a dry clear day&mdash;and all the folk were at
the church, with old Colin the minister sweating at it for the good of the
Ceannloch fishermen in the loft. He was in the middle of his prayer when a
noise came over the town, a dunting of hoofs on the causey of the
Provost's house-front.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said the cunning Colin, quick as could be, and then, &ldquo;Friends,
here is news for us,&rdquo; and down the pulpit steps he ran briskly like a lad
of twenty.
</p>
<p>
Peter MacIntyre set back the bolt from the door with a bang, and past him
the people made rush. The Duke's rider from over the Rest was there in the
saddle of a grey garron foaming at the mouth and its hurdies in a tremble.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your tidings, your tidings, good man!&rdquo; cried the people.
</p>
<p>
The lad sat stark in the saddle, with his eyes wet and his nose pricking
with the Gaelic pride.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have been at the Castle, and-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your news, just man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have been at the Castle, and Mac-Cailein Mor, who said I rode well from
the Rest, said I might come in-by and carry my budget to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Out with it, Paruig, little hero. Is't good or ill?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What would it be, my heroes, with our own lads, but good? Where's the
beat of them? It's 'The Glen is Mine' Dol' Dubh will be playing this day
on Culloden, for ours is the battle. They scattered the dirty Northmen and
the Irishers like chaff, and Cailein Mor himself gave me a horn of ale
from his own hands on the head o't.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A roar went up that stirred the crows on Scaurnoch, and there was a Sunday
spoiled for you; for the ale went free and merry in the change-house at
the Duke's charge till the moon was over Ben Ime.
</p>
<p>
But there were five houses with the clocks stopped (for the ghosts take no
heed of time); five houses with the glasses turned face to the wall (for
who dare look in glass to see a wraith at the back of the shoulder?);
there were four widows and five mothers wet faced, keening for five fine
men who had been, and whose names were now writ on paper on the church
door.
</p>
<h3>
III.
</h3>
<p>
Day followed day, and still home came no Campbells. They were far to the
dreary North, plying sword and fire among the bad clans, harrying for the
glory of Mac-Cailein Mor.
</p>
<p>
And at last on a day the sea-pigs rolled and blew off Stron Point, and the
scarts dived like arrows from the sun's eye, deep into a loch boiling with
fish. Night found the brown sails bellying out on the scudding smacks, and
the snouts of skiff and galley tearing the waves to get among the spoil.
Bow-to-back, the nets spotted Finne mile on mile; the kind herrings
crowded thick into them; the old luck was back, and the quays in the
morning heard the fine tune of the cadger's clinking silver. In a hurry of
hurries the fleet came up to the mouth of Shira&mdash;Tarbert men,
Strathlachlan men, Minard men, black fellows from MacCallum country, and
the wine-traffickers from French Foreland to swap sour claret for the
sweet fat fish.
</p>
<p>
It was ho-rol and spill the bicker in yon town, for all that the best of
its men were away and afar at the killing. The smoke was black from the
fires in the Cooper's Pool, the good healthy smell of the gut-pots sought
up to the Castle door. Little doubt his Grace (<i>beannachd leis!</i>)
would come out to the door-step and curse because it made him bock his
breakfast, dainty man!
</p>
<p>
Throng though the town was, round about the little house on the left of
the Lowlands Road crept a queer quietness. The cow had dried, and the dull
weather kept the spout fish too deep down in the sand for the ready
fingers to reach them. So the household of Rob Donn starved to the bone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To-morrow&mdash;they will be home tomorrow,&rdquo; said Jean to herself every
day to keep up her heart; but the days went by, and though it was
something to know that Rob was not among the killed at Culloden, it was
not something to stay the stomach. A stone-throw off were the best and
kindest hearts in the world: the woman's cousin, the rich merchant, would
give all he had on his board if he knew her trouble, and friends without
number would share the last bite with her. But to ask it would be to say
she was at the lowest, and to tell that Rob had left her nothing, and she
would sooner die in her pride.
</p>
<p>
Such people as passed her way&mdash;and some of them old gossips&mdash;would
have gone in, but the withie was aye across the door, and that's the sign
that business is doing within no one dare disturb. The withie was ever
there except at night, when Jean was scouring the countryside for
something to eat.
</p>
<p>
The bairn dwined so fast that even the mother (and blind indeed's the
mother at that bit) saw a little of it. There was no longer the
creepie-stool at the back of the house, in the sun, and the bairn on it,
watching the birds; her shanks grew thin like spirtles; her eyes sank far
ben in her face, and she would not go the length of the door. She sat at
the fireside and laughed her poor cold laugh less every day, till one long
thought came to her that kept her busy at the thinking from morning till
night with a face like a <i>cailleach</i> of eighty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;White love, white love,&rdquo; Jean would be saying, &ldquo;your father is on the
road with stots and a pouch of cockades.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At that the bairn would come back from her roaming; but soon she was off
again into the deeps of mind, her wide eyes like the windows of an empty
house for all that could be seen through them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! but it will be the fine cockade,&rdquo; poor Jean would press&mdash;&ldquo;what
am I saying?&mdash;the pack of your father will be full of them. Not the
white ones of silk only, but the red and the grassy green, my little calf.
You'll be wearing them when you will.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
No heeding in the bairn's face.
</p>
<p>
Then Jean would go out and pull the tansy at the door, and give it to the
little one to get the fine scent. The curious shells from the shore, too,
would she gather, and lay in rings about the chair, and call her the Queen
in her castle. For ever would there be a song at her lips, even if the
drops would be in her eyes&mdash;old daft songs from fairs and weddings,
and fairy rhyming and cheery stories about the Good People up on Sithean
Sluaidhe. Her fingers were for ever soft about the bairn, her flesh and
blood, stroking in the hair, softening the cushion, petting her in every
hand's-turn. She made a treat to herself by asking her, now and then,
something that had to be answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; was so sweet
in her ears that she would be content to hear no more in all her lifetime.
</p>
<p>
All the day the bairn crouched up in a hoop-chair with her neck slack and
her chin on her breast. Jean was loth to leave her in her bed in the
mornings, for she had a notion that to get her out of the blankets and to
put her in the clothes of the busy world would be to keep her in the trim
for living on.
</p>
<p>
Still there was no sign of the men returning. Often was Jean's foot at the
door and her hand over her eyes to see if there was no stir at Stron or
Kilachatrine, and but for good stuff, her heart failed five-score times
a-day.
</p>
<p>
At last, on a day of days, the bairn could not be stirred to notice
anything. The tansy fell out of her fingers, and she picked at the wool of
the plaid that wrapped her; the shells had no charm for her eye.
</p>
<p>
Jean made the pack of the coming father as routh as a magic cave. &ldquo;That
father of yours, darling, what a many wonderful things he will bring! I
see him on the road. Stots, and cows with milk brimming from the udders,
and a pet sheep for his <i>caileag bheag</i>; pretty gold and silver
things, and brooches and shining stuff. That father of yours! Hurry,
father, hurry! Jingling things, and wee fairy-men, and bells to ring for
you, m' eudail; pretty glasses and dishes to play with, and&mdash;O my
darling! my darling!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The bairn's face lost the deep red spots; her little mouth slacked and
fell; her eyes shut on the sight of the fine things her poor mother made
for her out of a rich and willing mind.
</p>
<p>
Jean lifted her and put her on the bed, and ran with a gutting-knife to
where Mally the dappled one lay at the back.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must be doing it!&rdquo; said the woman, and she bled the brute as they do in
the poor years in Lorn, and took the cogie of blood into the house to make
a pudding of. The last handful of meal in the girael went into the pot
with the warm blood, and she was stirring it with a spoon over the fire
when the child cluttered at the throat.
</p>
<p>
Jean turned about with a cry, and at the minute a bagpipe's lilting came
over the glassy bay from Stron Point.
</p>
<p>
It was Clan Campbell back from the wars, the heroes! clouted about the
heads and with stains on their red waistcoats that were thicker than wine
makes. Dol' Dubh played the old port, sweet and jaunty, at the head of
them; the Cornal and the Major snuffed the herrings and said, &ldquo;Here's our
own place, sure enough! See the smoke from our own peats! And the fine
cock of the cap on Dunchuach!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
On the Lowlands road the town emptied itself, and the folks ran fast and
furious&mdash;the boys first, the young women next, and the old folks
peching behind. But if the town was up on the warriors soon, the Duke
himself was before it. He saw the first of the Company from the Castle,
and he was in the saddle for all his threescore, like a boy, and down like
the wind to Boshang Gate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried the Cornal to his men, and Dol' Dubh's bag emptied itself
with a grant.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Tha sibh an sol!</i> You are here, cousin,&rdquo; said the Duke. &ldquo;Proud am I
to see you and our good lads. They did the old trick well!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They did that, MacCailein. The stuff's aye to the fore.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's in the blood, man. We have't in us, high or low. I have but one
thing to vex me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Name it, cousin.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well ye ken, Cornai. It's that I had not been with you to see the last
crushing Clan Campbell may need to give to an asp's head.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was a good ploy missed, I'll not deny.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What about the Tearlach one? Well plucked, they are telling me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As foolish a lad as ever put tartan on hip, my lord! Frenchy, Frenchy,
MacCailein! all outside and no cognisance. Yourself or any of your
forebears at the head of his clans could have scoured all Albainn of
Geordie's Low-Country red-coats, and yet there were only six thousand true
Gaels in all the fellow's corps.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To read my letters, you would think the whole North was on fire!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A bantam's crow, cousin. Clan Campbell itself could have thrawed the neck
of it at any time up to Dunedin.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They made a fair stand, did they not?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Uch! Poor eno'&mdash;indeed it was not what you would call a coward's
tulzie either.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, that's over, lads I I am proud of my clan and town. <i>Slochd
a Chubair gu bragh!</i> Stack your guns in the arm-room, see your wives
and bairns, and come up-by to the Castle for the heroes' bite and sup.
Who's that with the white cockade in his bonnet? Is't Rob Donn?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is Rob Donn, cousin, with a bit of the ribbon contrivance for the
diversion of his bairn. He tore it from the bonnet of the seventh man he
put an end to.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's luck in the number, any way, though it was a dear plaything.
March!&rdquo; Down the road, with their friends hanging about them, and the boys
carrying guns and knapsacks, went the men for the town, and Rob Donn left
the company as it passed near his own door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith! 'tis a poor enough home-coming, without wife or bairn to meet
one,&rdquo; said he, as he pushed in the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wife! wife!&rdquo; he cried ben among the peat-reek, &ldquo;there's never a stot, but
here's the cockade for the little one!&rdquo;

<h2>
A FINE PAIR OF SHOES
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE beginnings of things are to be well considered&mdash;we have all a
little of that art; but to end well and wisely is the gift of few. Hunters
and herds on the corri and the hill&mdash;they are at the simple end of
life, and ken the need for the task complete. The stag must be gralloched
ere ye brag of him, the drove must be at the market ere ye say anything of
the honesty of the glens ye pass through.
</p>
<p>
And what I like best about our own Gaels is their habit of bringing the
work of a day or the work of a lifetime to what (in their own notions) is
an end round and polished.
</p>
<p>
When our women die, they do it with something of a daintiness. Their
dead-clothes are in the awmrie; I have seen them with the cakes toasted
and the board set for their funerals. Travelling wide on unfriendly
foreign roads, living by sword or wit, you know that our men, the poorest
among them, with an empty sporran, kept the buttons of their duds of good
silver, to pay, if need be, for something more than a gangrel's burial. I
like to think of him in story who, at his end in bed, made the folk trick
him out in gallant style with tartan, targe, brogue, and bonnet, and the
sword in his hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A Gaelic gentleman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;should come to his journey's end somewhat
snod and well-put-on.&rdquo; And his son played &ldquo;Cha till mi tuilidh&rdquo; (&ldquo;I return
no more&rdquo;) on the bag-pipe by his firm command.
</p>
<p>
It is not even in this unco undertaking of Death that the polish must be
put on the task (though poor's the creature who dies clumsily); it should
be the same with every task of a day.
</p>
<p>
And so Baldi Crom, making a fine pair of shoes on a day in Carnus, put the
best skill of his fingers to every stitch. He had been working at them
since the command came in the morning, and now it was the mouth of night,
and on one of them the finest of the fine sewing was still to do. About
the place there was nobody but the old man, for he was the last, in a way,
of the old stock of Carnus (now a <i>larach</i> of low lintels, and the
nettle over all); and he was without woman to put <i>caschrom</i> to his
soil or hip to a creel of peats. And so he lived on the brae of Camus&mdash;that
same far up and lonely in the long glen.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They'll be the best I ever put brog in,&rdquo; said he, looking fondly at the
fine work, the yellow thread standing out on the toes, patterned like a
leaf of the whortleberry, set about with the serpent-work of the old
crosses. Bite nor sap, kail nor crowdie, did he taste all day. Working in
the light of his open door, he could see, if he had the notion, the whole
glen rolled out before him, brimming with sun, crossed in the heat of the
day by deer from Dalavich seeking for the woods of Loch Finne; the blue
reek of the townships at the far end might have cheered him with the
thought that life was in sight though his house was lonely. But crouped
over the lap-stone, he made love to his work, heeding nothing else but the
sewing of the fine pair of shoes.
</p>
<p>
It was the night before the town market. Droves of bellowing cattle&mdash;heifers,
stots, and stirks&mdash;were going down the glen from Port Sonachan,
cropping hurried mouthfuls by the way as they went and as the dogs would
let them. And three Benderloch drovers came off the road and into Baldi
Crom's house, after the night was down on the glen and he had the cruisie
lighted. They sat them down round the fire in the middle of the floor and
ate bannocks and cheese.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How's thy family, 'Illeasbuig?&rdquo; said a drover, stirring up the peat as if
he were at his own door-end. Down on the roadside the cattle, black and
yellow, crushed the sappy grass and mourned in bellows for their lost
fields.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Splendid! splendid!&rdquo; said the old man, double over his shoes, fondling
them with the fingers of a mother on a first baby. The light was low in
the cruisie, for the oil was well down, and the fire and the cruisie made
a ring of light that could scarcely slip over the backs of the men sitting
round the peats. A goat scratched his head but-and-ben against the
wattles; in corners the darkness was brown and thick.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hear Cailen's in the Low-country, but what has come of Tormaid?&rdquo; said
one, with knee-breeches, and hose of coarse worsted.
</p>
<p>
The old man gave a quick start, and the lapstone fell from his knees, the
shoe he was at with it. He bent over and felt like a blind man for them on
the floor before he made answer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tormaid, my gallant son! Ye have not heard of him lately, then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never a word, 'Illeasbuig. People on the going foot, like drovers, hear
all the world's gossip but the <i>sgeuls</i> of their own <i>sgireachd</i>.
We have been far North since Martinmas: for us there must be many a story
to tell 'twixt here and Inneraora. A stout lad and pretty, Tormaid too, as
ever went to the beginning of fortune! Where might he be enow?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here and there, friend, here and there! A restless scamp, a wanderer, but
with parts. Had he not the smart style at the game of <i>camanachi?</i> He
was namely for it in many places.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As neat a player as ever took shinty in hand, master! I have the name of
a fair player myself, but that much I'll allow your lad. Is he to the West
side, or farther off?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Farther off, friend. The pipes now&mdash;have you heard him as a player
on the chanter?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As a piper, 'Illeasbuig! His like was not in three shires. I have heard
him at reel and march, but these were not his fancy: for him the <i>piobaireachds</i>
that scholarly ones play!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My gallant boy!&rdquo; said Baldi Crom, rubbing soft on the shoe with the palm
of a hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Once upon a time,&rdquo; said the drover, &ldquo;we were on our way to a Lowland
Tryst. Down Glen Falloch a Soccach man and I heard him fill the nightfall
with the 'Bhoilich' of Morar, with the brag of a whole clan in his
warbling. He knew piping, the fellow with me, and the tear came to his
cheek, thinking of the old days and the old ploys among the dirks and <i>sgians</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There was never the beat of him,&rdquo; said the shoemaker.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Throughither a bit&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But good, good at heart, man! With a better chance of fortune he might be
holding his head to-day as high as the best of them.&rdquo; The drovers looked
at each other with a meaning that was not for the eyes of the old man; but
he had small chance of seeing it, for he was throng at his fine pair of
shoes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He had a name for many arts,&rdquo; said the man with coarse hose, &ldquo;but they
were not the arts that give a lad settlement and put money in his purse.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The hot young head, man! He would have cured,&rdquo; said the old man, sewing
hard. &ldquo;Think of it,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;was ever a more humoursome fellow to walk a
glen with? His songs, his stories, his fast jump at one's meaning, and his
trick of leaving all about him in a good key with themselves and him. Did
ever one ask a Saxon shilling from his purse that it was not a cheery gift
if the purse held it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;True, indeed!&rdquo; said the drovers, eating bannocks and cheese.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Twixt heaven and hell,&rdquo; said the fellow with the coarse hose, &ldquo;is but a
spang. It's so easy for some folk to deserve the one gate&mdash;so many
their gifts&mdash;that the cock-sureness leaves them careless, and they
wander into the wrong place.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You were speaking?&rdquo; said Baldi, a little angry, though he heard but half.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I said thy son was a fellow of many gifts,&rdquo; answered the drover, in a
confusion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He had no unfriends that I ken of,&rdquo; said the old man, busy at the shoes;
&ldquo;young or old, man or woman.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Especially woman,&rdquo; put in another drover, wrinkling at the eyes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I've had five sons: three in the King's service, and one in the
Low-country; here's my young wanderer, and he was&mdash;he is&mdash;the
jewel of them all!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You hear of him sometimes?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I heard of him and from him this very day,&rdquo; said Baldi, busy at the
brogues, white and drawn at the face and shaking at the lips. &ldquo;I have
worked at these shoes since morning, and little time is there to put bye
on them, for at Inneraora town must they be before breakfast. Solomon
Carrier, passing at three, gives me a cry and takes them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They're a fine pair of shoes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Fine indeed; the finest of the fine! They're for a particular one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Duke John himself, perhaps?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, man; a particular one, and were they not his in time a sorry man was
I. They're the best Baldi Crom ever put leather on.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Till the turn of the night the drovers slept in their plaids, their cattle
steaming out-by in the dark, munching the coarse grass selvedge, breathing
heavy. And when the men and their beasts went in the darkness of the
morning, Baldi Crom was still throng at his fine pair of shoes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm late, I'm surely late,&rdquo; said he, toiling hard, but with no
sloven-work, at his task.
</p>
<p>
The rain had come with the morning, and was threshing out-by on peat and
thatch. Inside, the fire died, and the cruisie gave warnings that its oil
was low, but Baldi Crom was too throng on the end of his task to notice.
And at last his house dropped into darkness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tormaid! Tormaid! my little hero&mdash;I'm sore feared you'll die without
shoes after all,&rdquo; cried the old man, staggering to the door for daylight.
He had the door but opened when he fell, a helpless lump, on the clay
floor. The rain slanted on his grey hairs and spat on a fine shoe.
</p>
<p>
Far down the good long glen the drovers were tramping after their cattle,
and the dun morning was just before them when they got to the gate of
Inneraora. Here there was a great to-do, for the kind gallows stood stark
before the Arches. Round about it were the townspeople waiting for a
hanging.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who is't, and what is't for?&rdquo; asked the drover with the knee-breeches and
the coarse hose, pushing into the crowd.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tormaid, the son of the Carnus cobbler,&rdquo; said a woman with a plaid over
her head. &ldquo;He killed a man in a brawl at Braleckan and raped his purse.
Little enough to put tow to a pretty lad's neck for, sure enough!&rdquo; &ldquo;Stand
clear there!&rdquo; cried a sharp voice, and the hangman and his friend came to
the scaffold's foot with a lad in front of them, his hands shackled behind
his back. He was a strong straight lad, if anything overly dour in the
look, and he wore a good coat and tiews, but neither boot nor bonnet.
Under the beam he put back his shoulders with a jerk and looked at the
folk below, then over at Dunchuach with the mist above the fort like
smoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They might have given him a pair of old baucbels, if no better, to die
in,&rdquo; said the drover in the woman's ear.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ochanoch!</i> and they might!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The darling! He lost his
shoes in swimming Duglas Water to get clear, and they say he sent
yesterday to his father for a pair, but they're not come. Queer, indeed,
is that, for 'twas the brag of the folks he came of that they aye died
with a good pair of shoon on their feet!&rdquo;

<h2>
CASTLE DARK.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>OU know Castle Dark, women?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, we know the same, just man and blind!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And you, my lads?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;None better, Paruig Dali; morning and night, in the moon and in the full
white day!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then of Castle Dark is my story. Is the cruisie alight on the rafter? More
peats, little one, on the fire.
</p>
<p>
Once upon a time Castle Dark was a place of gentility and stirring days.
You have heard it,&mdash;you know it; now it is like a deer's skull in
Wood Mamore, empty, eyeless, sounding to the whistling wind, but blackened
instead of bleached in the threshing rains. When the day shines and the
sun coaxes the drowsy mists from the levels by the river, that noble house
that was brisks up and grey-whitens, minding maybe of merry times; the
softest smirr of rain&mdash;and the scowl comes to corbie-stone and gable;
black, black grow the stones of old ancient Castle Dark! Little one, <i>m'
eudail</i>, put the door to, and the sneck down.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;True for you, Paruig Dali; you know the place as if you had seen it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
With eyes Paruig Dali has never seen it. But my friends tell me what they
know, and beyond I have learned of myself. Up the river-side, many a time
I pass to the place and over its low dykes, dry-stone, broken and
crumbling to the heel. The moss is soft on the little roads, so narrow and
so without end, winding round the land; the nettle cocks him right
braggardly over the old home of bush and flower, poisoning the air. Where
the lady dozed in her shady seat below the alder-tree, looking out between
half-shut eyes at the proud Highlands&mdash;loch, glen, and mountain&mdash;is
but a root rotten, and hacked by the woodman's whittle. A tangle of wild
wood, bracken, and weed smothers the rich gardens of Castle Dark.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is so, it is so, Paruig Dali, blind man, prince among splendid pipers
and storied men!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And to stand on the broad clanging steps that lifted from the hunting-road
to the great door&mdash;that is a thinking man's trial. To me, then, will
be coming graveyard airs, yellow and vexatious, searching eager through my
bones for this old man's last weakness. &ldquo;Thou sturdy dog!&rdquo; will they be
saying, &ldquo;some day, some day! Look at this strong tower!&rdquo; With an ear to
the gap on the side of the empty ditch, I can hear the hollowness of the
house rumbling with pains, racked at <i>cabar</i> and corner-stone, the
thought and the song gone clean away. There is no window, then, that has
not a complaint of its own; no loop-hole, no vent, no grassy chimney that
the blind fellow cannot hear the pipe of. Straight into the heart's core
of Castle Dark looks the sun; the deep tolbooth of the old reivers and the
bed-chamber of the maid are open wide to the night and to the star!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ochan! ochan!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
You that only ken the castle in common day or night and plain man's
weather have but little notion of its wonders. It was there, and black and
hollow, ere ever you were born, or Paruig Dali. To see Castle Dark one
must take the Blue Barge and venture on two trips.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Blue Barge, just man?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
That same. The <i>birlinn ghorm</i>, the galley of fairy Lorn. It lies in
the sunlight on the bay, or the moonlight in certain weathers, and twelve
of the handsomest sit on the seats with the oars in their hands, the red
shirt bulging over the kilt-belt. At the stem of the barge is the chair of
the visitor. Gentle or semple, 'tis the same boat and crew, and the same
cushioned chair, for all that make the jaunt to Castle Dark. My story is
of two trips a man made by Barge Blue up the river to the white stairs.
</p>
<p>
He roved round the Lowlands road on a fine summer day, and out on the
sands among the running salt threads of ebb tide. Among the shells, his
eyes (as it might be) fell on the castle, and he had a notion to make the
trip to it by a new road. Loudly he piped to sea. If loudly he piped, keen
was the hearing, for yonder came the galley of fairy Lorn, the twelve
red-shirts swinging merry at the oars and chanting a Skye <i>iorram</i>.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here's an exploit!&rdquo; said the man of my story. &ldquo;There's dignity in yon
craft, or less than red-shirts was the wearing of the scamps who row her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The loch curled like a feather before her and frothed far behind, and soon
her nose ran high on the sand. No word was said, but the first pair of
rowers let out a carved plank, and the fellow of my story went over it and
behind to the chair with the cushioned seat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To the castle?&rdquo; asked the captain (as it might be), in the way of one who
speaks a master, and Adventurer said, &ldquo;Castle be it.&rdquo; The barge was pushed
off the sand, the oars fell on the water, and she curved into the
river-mouth.
</p>
<p>
When Adventurer reached the bridge, it was before the time of war, and the
country from end to end sat quiet, free, and honest. Our folks lived the
clean out-by life of shepherds and early risers. Round these hills, the
woods&mdash;the big green woods&mdash;were trembling with bird and beast,
and the two glens were crowded with warm homes&mdash;every door open, and
the cattle untethered on the hill. Summer found the folks like ourselves
here, far up on sappy levels among the hills, but their sheilings more
their own than ours are, with never a reiver nor a broken clan in all the
land. Good stout roads and dry went down the passes to Castle Dark from
all airts of Albainn&mdash;roads for knight and horse, but free and safe
for the gentlest girl ever so lonely. By sea came gabberts of far France
with wine and drink; by land the carriers brought rich cloths, spices, and
Italian swords such as never were before or since. I made a small <i>piobaireachd</i>
once on such a blade; if you put me over my pipes, I&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Later the pipes, Paruig Dali, the best player in the world! to thy story
this time.&rdquo; Is the cup to my right or left? Blessings! The Castle and
Barge were my story.
</p>
<p>
Up and on, then, under the bridge, went Adventurer and his company of
twelve, and he trailed white fingers over the low side of the boat, the
tide warm like new milk. Under the long arch he held up his head and
whooped gaily, like the boy he was in another dream, and Mactallamh
laughed back from behind the smell of lime-drop and <i>crotal</i> hanging
to the stones. Then into the sun again, on the wide flat river, with the
fields sloping down on each hand, nodding to the lip with rush and flower.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith and here's fortune!&rdquo; said Adventurer. &ldquo;Such a day for sailing and
sights was never before.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And the Blue Barge met nor stone nor stay, but ever the twelve fine lads
swinging cheerily at the oars, till they came to the white stairs.
</p>
<p>
Off the boat and up the clanging steps went Adventurer as bold as Eachan,
and the bushes waving soft on every side. The gravel crunched to his foot&mdash;the
white round gravel of Cantyre; kennelled hounds cried warning from the
ditch-side; round him were the scenting flowers and the feeling of the
little roads winding so without end all about the garden.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Queer is this!&rdquo; said he, feeling the grass-edge with his feet and
fingering the leaves. &ldquo;Here, surely, is weed nor nettle, but the trim bush
and the swinging rose. The gardeners have been busy in the gardens of old
ancient Castle Dark!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
When he came to the ditch, the drawbrig was down. To the warm airs of the
day the windows, high and low, were open; a look of throng life was over
the house, and in-by some one plucked angrily at the strings of a harp.
Reek rose lazy and blue over the chimneys, the smell of roasting meats and
rich broths hung on the air.
</p>
<p>
Under a tree got Adventurer and deep in thought. And soon the harping came
to an end. A girl stepped to the bridge and over into the garden. She took
to the left by the butter-house and into My Lady's Canter, lined with
foreign trees. Along the wide far road came a man to meet her,
good-shaped, in fine clothes, tartan trews fitting close on leg and
haunch, and a leather jacket held at the middle by a <i>crioslach</i>.
</p>
<p>
Under his tree stood Adventurer as they passed back, and close beside him
the courtier pushed the hilt of a small-sword to his back and took the
woman in his arms.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then if ye must ken,&rdquo; said he, shamefacedly, &ldquo;I am for the road
to-morrow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The girl&mdash;ripe and full, not over-tall, well balanced, her hair waved
back from over brown eyes, gathered in a knot and breaking to a curl on
the nape of the neck like a wave on the shell-white shore&mdash;got hot at
the skin, and a foot drummed the gravel in an ill temper.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;For yon silly cause again?&rdquo; she asked, her lips thinning over her teeth.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;For the old cause,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;my father's, my dead brothers', my clan's,
ours for a hundred years. Do not lightly the cause, my dear; it may be
your children's yet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You never go with my will,&rdquo; quo' the girl again. &ldquo;Here am I, far from a
household of cheery sisters, so lonely, so lonely! Oh! Morag and Aoirig,
and the young ones! were I back among them from this brave tomb!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tomb, sweet!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tomb said I, and tomb is it!&rdquo; cried the woman, in a storm. &ldquo;Who is here
to sing with me and comfort me in the misty mornings, to hearten me when
you are at wood or hill? The dreary woods, the dreary, dreary shore&mdash;they
give me the gloom! My God, what a grey day!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
(And yet, by my troth, 'twas a sunny day by the feel of it, and the birds
were chirming on every tree!)
</p>
<p>
The gentleman put his hands on the girl's shoulder and looked deep in her
eyes, thinking hard for a wee, and biting at his low lip in a nervous way.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At night,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I speak to you of chase and the country-side's
gossip. We have sometimes neighbours in our house as now,&mdash;old
Askaig's goodwife and the Nun from Inishail&mdash;a good woman and pious.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Up went the lady's head, and she laughed bitter and long.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My good husband,&rdquo; she said, in a weary way, &ldquo;you are like all that wear
trews; you have never trained your tracking but to woodcraft, or else you
had found the wild-kit in a woman's heart.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's my love, girl, and I think you love&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tuts, man! I talked not of that. Love is&mdash;love, while it lasts, and
ye brag of Askaig's wife and the Nun (good Lord!), and the old harridans
your cousins from Lochow!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Tis but a tirrivie of yours, my dear,&rdquo; said the man, kindly, kissing her
on the teeth, and she with her hands behind her back. &ldquo;Tomorrow the
saddle, Sir Claymore, and the south country! Hark ye, sweet, I'll fetch
back the most darling thing woman ever dreamt of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What might his name be?&rdquo; asked the girl, laughing, but still with a
bitterness, and the two went round to the ditch-brig and in-by.
</p>
<p>
Adventurer heard the little fine airs coming from the west, coiling, full
of sap-smell, crooning in turret and among the grassy gable-tops, and
piping into the empty windows.
</p>
<p>
'Twas a summer's end when he went on the next jaunt, a hot night and hung
with dripping stars. The loch crawled in from a black waste of sorrow and
strange hills, and swished on the shore, trailing among the wreck with the
hiss of fingers through ribbons of silk. My dears, my dears! the gloom of
hidden seas in night and lonely places! 'Tis that dauntens me. I will be
standing sometimes at the night's down-fall over above the bay, and
hearkening to the grinding of the salt wash on rock and gravel, and never
a sound of hope or merriment in all that weary song. You that have seeing
may ken the meaning of it; never for Paruig Dali but wonder and the heavy
heart!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Tis our thought a thousand times, just man; we are the stour that wind
and water make the clod of! You spoke of a second jaunt?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As ye say. It was in winter; and the morning&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Winter, said ye, Paruig Dali? 'Twas summer and night before.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Winter I said, and winter it was, before <i>faoilteach</i>, and the edge
of the morning. The fellow of my <i>sgeul</i>, more than a twelvemonth
older, went to the breast wall and cried on Barge Blue that's ever waiting
for the sailor who's for sailing on fairy seas.
</p>
<p>
In she came, with her twelve red-shirts tugging bravely at the oars, and
the nose of her ripping the salt bree. Out, too, the carved plank, made,
I'll warrant, by the Norwegian fellow who fashioned the Black Bed of
MacArtair, and over it to the cushioned seat Adventurer!
</p>
<p>
The little waves blobbed and bubbled at the boat's shoulders; she put
under the arch and up the cold river to the white stairs.
</p>
<p>
It was the middle and bloodiest time of all our wars. The glens behind
were harried, and their cattle were bellowing in strange fields. Widows
grat on the brae-sides and starved with their bairns for the bere and oat
that were burned. But Adventurer found a castle full of company, the rich
scum of water-side lairds and Lowland gentry, dicing and drinking in the
best hall of Castle Dark. Their lands were black, their homes levelled, or
their way out of the country&mdash;if they were Lowland&mdash;was barred
by jealous clans. So there they were, drinking the reddest and eating the
fattest&mdash;a wanton crew, among them George Mor, namely for women and
wine and gentlemanly sword-play.
</p>
<p>
They had been at the cartes after supper. Wine lay on the table in rings
and rivers. The curtains were across the window, and the candles guttered
in the sconces. Debauched airs flaffed abroad in the room. At the head of
the board, with her hair falling out of the knot, the lady of the house
dovered in her chair, her head against George Mor's shoulder, and him
sleeping fast with his chin on his vest. Two company girls from the house
in the forest slept forward on the table, their heads on the thick of
their arms, and on either hand of them the lairds and foreigners. Of the
company but two were awake, playing at <i>bord-dubh</i>, small eyed,
oozing with drink. But they slept by-and-by like the lave, and sleep had a
hold of Castle Dark through and through.
</p>
<p>
Adventurer heard the cock crow away at the gean-tree park.
</p>
<p>
One of the girls, stirring in her sleep, touched a glass with her elbow,
and it fell on its side, the dark wine splashing over the table, crawling
to the edge, thudding in heavy drops on the shoe of the mistress of the
house, who drew back her foot without waking. But her moving started up
the man at her ear. He looked at her face, kissed her on the hair, and got
to his feet with no noise. A sour smile curdled his face when he looked
about the room, drunken and yellow-sick in the guttering candlelight.
</p>
<p>
Stretching himself, he made for the window and pulled back the curtain.
</p>
<p>
The mountain looked in on the wastrel company, with a black and blaming
scowl&mdash;the mountain set in blackness at the foot, but its brow
touching the first of a cold day.
</p>
<p>
Tree and bush stood like wraiths all about the garden, the river cried
high and snell. George Mor turned and looked at the room and its sleeping
company like corpses propped in chairs, in the light of candle and
daybreak.
</p>
<p>
The smell of the drunken chamber fogged at the back of his throat. He
laughed in a kind of bitter way, the lace shaking at his neck and
wrist-bands: then his humour changed, and he rued the night and his merry
life.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish I was yont this cursed country,&rdquo; said he to himself, shivering
with cold. &ldquo;'Tis these folk lead me a pretty spring, and had George Mor
better luck of his company he was a decent man. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;who's
George Mor to be better than his neighbours? As grow the fir-trees, some
of them crooked and some of them straight, and we are the way the winds
would have us!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He was standing in the window yet, deep in the morning's grief, running
his fingers among his curls.
</p>
<p>
Without warning the door of the room opened, and a man took one step in,
soft, without noise, white-faced, and expecting no less than he found, by
the look in his eyes. It was the goodwife's husband, still with the mud on
his shoes and the sword on his belt. He beckoned on the fellow at the
window, and went before him (the company still in their sleep), making for
the big door, and George Mor as he followed lifted a sword from a pin.
</p>
<p>
Close by Adventurer the two men stopped. It was on a level round of old
moss, damp but springy, hid from the house by some saugh-trees.
</p>
<p>
The master of the house spoke first. Said he, &ldquo;It's no great surprise;
they told me at the ferry over-by that strange carry-on and George Mor
were keeping up the wife's heart in Castle Dark.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She's as honest a wife as ever&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Fairly, fairly, I'll allow&mdash;when the wind's in that airt. It's been
a dull place this for her, and I have small skill of entertainment; but,
man, I thought of her often, away in the camp!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He was taking off his jacket as he spoke, and looking past George Mor's
shoulder and in between the trees at the loch. And now the day was fairly
on the country.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A bit foolish is your wife&mdash;just a girl, I'm not denying; but true
at the core.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Young, young, as ye say, man! She'll make, maybe, all the more taking a
widow woman. She'll need looks and gaiety indeed, for my poor cause is
lost for good and all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We saved the castle for you, at any rate. But for my friends in-by and
myself the flambeau was at the root o't.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So, my hero? In another key I might be having a glass with you over such
friendship, but the day spreads and here's our business before us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I've small stomach for this. It's a fool's quarrel.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Thoir an aire!</i>&mdash;Guard, George Mor!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They fought warmly on the mossy grass, and the tinkle of the thin blades
set the birds chirping in the bushes, but it could not be that that
wakened my lady dovering in her chair in the room of guttering candles.
</p>
<p>
She started up in a dream, and found George Mor gone, and the mark of
muddy brogues near the door fitted in with her dream. She wakened none of
her drugged company, but hurried to the garden and in between the foreign
trees to the summons of the playing swords.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop, stop, husband!&rdquo; she cried before she saw who was at the fighting;
but only George Mor heard, and he half turned his head.
</p>
<p>
She was a little late. Her man, with a forefinger, was feeling the way to
the scabbard, and a gout of blood was gathering at the point of his sword,
when she got through the trees.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said he, cool enough but short in the breath, and bloody a
little at the mouth, &ldquo;here's your gallant. He had maybe skill at
diversion, but I've seen better at the small-sword. To-night my un-friends
are coming back to harry Castle Dark, and I'm in little humour to stop
them. Fare ye weel!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A blash of rain threshed in Adventurer's face; the tide crept at his feet,
the fall of the oars on Barge Blue sank low and travelled far off. It was
the broad day. Over above the river, Castle Dark grew black, but the
fellow of my story could not see it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And the woman, Paruig Dali? What came of the woman?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Another peat on the fire, little one. So! <i>That</i> the fellow of my
story would need another trip to see. But Barge Blue is the ferry for all,
high tide or low, in the calm and in the storm.
